       "'CHAPTER I\\n\\nLucy Looks into a Wardrobe\\n\\nOnce there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office. He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs. Macready and three servants. (Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the story much.) He himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair, which grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and they liked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he was so odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little afraid of him, and Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.\\n\\nAs soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night, the boys came into the girls\\' room and they all talked it over.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve fallen on our feet and no mistake,\" said Peter. \"This is going to be perfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.\"\\n\\n\"I think he\\'s an old dear,\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Oh, come off it!\" said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, which always made him bad-tempered. \"Don\\'t go on talking like that.\"\\n\\n\"Like what?\" said Susan; \"and anyway, it\\'s time you were in bed.\"\\n\\n\"Trying to talk like Mother,\" said Edmund. \"And who are you to say when I\\'m to go to bed? Go to bed yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t we all better go to bed?\" said Lucy. \"There\\'s sure to be a row if we\\'re heard talking here.\"\\n\\n\"No there won\\'t,\" said Peter. \"I tell you this is the sort of house where no one\\'s going to mind what we do. Anyway, they won\\'t hear us. It\\'s about ten minutes\\' walk from here down to that dining room, and any amount of stairs and passages in between.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that noise?\" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only a bird, silly,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an owl,\" said Peter. \"This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bed now. I say, let\\'s go and explore to-morrow. You might find anything in a place like this. Did you see those mountains as we came along? And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags. There\\'ll be hawks.\"\\n\\n\"Badgers!\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Snakes!\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Foxes!\" said Susan.\\n\\nBut when next morning came, there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.\\n\\n\"Of course it would be raining!\" said Edmund. They had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them—a long, low room with two windows looking out in one direction and two in another.\\n\\n\"Do stop grumbling, Ed,\" said Susan. \"Ten to one it\\'ll clear up in an hour or so. And in the meantime we\\'re pretty well off. There\\'s a wireless and lots of books.\"\\n\\n\"Not for me,\" said Peter, \"I\\'m going to explore in the house.\"\\n\\nEveryone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places. The first few doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to a very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour; and after that was a room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and then came three steps down and five steps up, and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into each other and were lined with books—most of them very old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door. There was nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue-bottle on the window-sill.\\n\\n\"Nothing there!\" said Peter, and they all trooped out again—all except Lucy. She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked. To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls dropped out.\\n\\nLooking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up—mostly long fur coats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe. She took a step further in—then two or three steps—always expecting to feel woodwork against the tips of her fingers. But she could not feel it.\\n\\n\"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\" thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. \"I wonder is that more moth-balls?\" she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hands. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold, \"This is very queer,\" she said, and went on a step or two further.\\n\\nNext moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. \"Why, it is just like branches of trees!\" exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.\\n\\nLucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree-trunks, she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out. (She had, of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) It seemed to be still daylight there. \"I can always get back if anything goes wrong,\" thought Lucy. She began to walk forward, crunch-crunch, over the snow and through the wood towards the other light.\\n\\nIn about ten minutes she reached it and found that it was a lamp-post. As she stood looking at it, wondering why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.\\n\\nHe was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella, white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped like a goat\\'s (the hair on them was glossy black) and instead of feet he had goat\\'s hoofs. He also had a tail, but Lucy did not notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too. He had a strange, but pleasant little face with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead. One of his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella: in the other arm he carried several brown paper parcels. What with the parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. He was a Faun. And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcels.\\n\\n\"Goodness gracious me!\" exclaimed the Faun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nWhat Lucy Found There\\n\\n\"Good evening,\" said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up his parcels that at first he did not reply. When he had finished he made her a little bow.\\n\\n\"Good evening, good evening,\" said the Faun. \"Excuse me—I don\\'t want to be inquisitive—but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?\"\\n\\n\"My name\\'s Lucy,\" said she, not quite understanding him.\\n\\n\"But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a girl?\" asked the Faun.\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'m a girl,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"You are in fact Human?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'m human,\" said Lucy, still a little puzzled.\\n\\n\"To be sure, to be sure,\" said the Faun. \"How stupid of me! But I\\'ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say—\" and then he stopped as if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time. \"Delighted, delighted,\" he went on. \"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus.\"\\n\\n\"I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"And may I ask, O Lucy, Daughter of Eve,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"how you have come into Narnia?\"\\n\\n\"Narnia? What\\'s that?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"This is the land of Narnia,\" said the Faun, \"where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you—you have come from the wild woods of the west?\"\\n\\n\"I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, \"if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now.\"\\n\\n\"But they aren\\'t countries at all,\" said Lucy, almost laughing. \"It\\'s only just back there—at least—I\\'m not sure. It is summer there.\"\\n\\n\"Meanwhile,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and had tea with me?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s only just round the corner,\" said the Faun, \"and there\\'ll be a roaring fire—and toast—and sardines—and cake.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s very kind of you,\" said Lucy. \"But I shan\\'t be able to stay long.\"\\n\\n\"If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us. That\\'s the way. Now—off we go.\"\\n\\nAnd so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives.\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr. Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr. Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. \"Now we shan\\'t be long,\" he said, and immediately put a kettle on.\\n\\nLucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs (\"one for me and one for a friend,\" said Mr. Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr. Tumnus\\' bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things. They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men, Monks and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?\\n\\n\"Now, Daughter of Eve!\" said the Faun.\\n\\nAnd really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white Stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. \"Not that it isn\\'t always winter now,\" he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said,\\n\\n\"Oh Mr. Tumnus—I\\'m so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune—but really, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good now, you know,\" said the Faun, laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully.\\n\\n\"No good?\" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. \"What do you mean? I\\'ve got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me.\" But a moment later she asked, \"Mr. Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?\" for the Faun\\'s brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down his cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of his nose; and at last he covered his face with his hands and began to howl.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tumnus! Mr. Tumnus!\" said Lucy in great distress. \"Don\\'t! Don\\'t! What is the matter? Aren\\'t you well? Dear Mr. Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong.\" But the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her handkerchief, he did not stop. He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tumnus!\" bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. \"Do stop. Stop it at once! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What on earth are you crying about?\"\\n\\n\"Oh—oh—oh!\" sobbed Mr. Tumnus, \"I\\'m crying because I\\'m such a bad Faun.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think you\\'re a bad Faun at all,\" said Lucy. \"I think you are a very good Faun. You are the nicest Faun I\\'ve ever met.\"\\n\\n\"Oh—oh—you wouldn\\'t say that if you knew,\" replied Mr. Tumnus between his sobs. \"No, I\\'m a bad Faun. I don\\'t suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world.\"\\n\\n\"But what have you done?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"My old father, now,\" said Mr. Tumnus, \"that\\'s his picture over the mantelpiece. He would never have done a thing like this.\"\\n\\n\"A thing like what?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Like what I\\'ve done,\" said the Faun. \"Taken service under the White Witch. That\\'s what I am. I\\'m in the pay of the White Witch.\"\\n\\n\"The White Witch? Who is she?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It\\'s she that makes it always winter. Always winter and never Christmas; think of that!\"\\n\\n\"How awful!\" said Lucy. \"But what does she pay you for?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the worst of it,\" said Mr. Tumnus with a deep groan. \"I\\'m a kidnapper for her, that\\'s what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would you believe that I\\'m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood, one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Lucy. \"I\\'m sure you wouldn\\'t do anything of the sort.\"\\n\\n\"But I have,\" said the Faun.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him), \"well, that was pretty bad. But you\\'re so sorry for it that I\\'m sure you will never do it again.\"\\n\\n\"Daughter of Eve, don\\'t you understand?\" said the Faun. \"It isn\\'t something I have done. I\\'m doing it now, this very moment.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Lucy, turning very white.\\n\\n\"You are the child,\" said Mr. Tumnus. \"I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and hand them over to her. And you are the first I ever met. And I\\'ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea, and all the time I\\'ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell her.\"\\n\\n\"Oh but you won\\'t, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"You won\\'t, will you? Indeed, indeed you really mustn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"And if I don\\'t,\" said he, beginning to cry again, \"she\\'s sure to find out. And she\\'ll have my tail cut off, and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she\\'ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse\\'s. And if she is extra and specially angry she\\'ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled—and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry, Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy. \"But please let me go home.\"\\n\\n\"Of course I will,\" said the Faun. \"Of course I\\'ve got to. I see that now. I hadn\\'t known what Humans were like before I met you. Of course I can\\'t give you up to the Witch; not now that I know you. But we must be off at once. I\\'ll see you back to the lamp-post. I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I can,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"We must go as quietly as we can,\" said Mr. Tumnus. \"The whole wood is full of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side.\"\\n\\nThey both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr. Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun\\'s cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and Mr. Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-post again.\\n\\n\"Do you know your way from here, Daughter of Eve?\" said Tumnus.\\n\\nLucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I can see the wardrobe door.\"\\n\\n\"Then be off home as quick as you can,\" said the Faun, \"and—c-can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, of course I can,\" said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand. \"And I do hope you won\\'t get into dreadful trouble on my account.\"\\n\\n\"Farewell, Daughter of Eve,\" said he. \"Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?\"\\n\\n\"Rather!\" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far-off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden boards, and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage.\\n\\n\"I\\'m here,\" she shouted. \"I\\'m here. I\\'ve come back, I\\'m all right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nEdmund and the Wardrobe\\n\\nLucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" she repeated, \"I\\'ve come back.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?\" asked Susan.\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Lucy in amazement, \"haven\\'t you all been wondering where I was?\"\\n\\n\"So you\\'ve been hiding, have you?\" said Peter. \"Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed! You\\'ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you.\"\\n\\n\"But I\\'ve been away for hours and hours,\" said Lucy.\\n\\nThe others all stared at one another.\\n\\n\"Batty!\" said Edmund tapping his head. \"Quite batty.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Lu?\" asked Peter.\\n\\n\"What I said,\" answered Lucy. \"It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I\\'ve been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of things have happened.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be silly, Lucy,\" said Susan. \"We\\'ve only just come out of that room a moment ago, and you were there then.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s not being silly at all,\" said Peter, \"she\\'s just making up a story for fun, aren\\'t you, Lu? And why shouldn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"No, Peter, I\\'m not,\" she said. \"It\\'s—it\\'s a magic wardrobe. There\\'s a wood inside it, and it\\'s snowing, and there\\'s a Faun and a witch and it\\'s called Narnia; come and see.\"\\n\\nThe others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her into the room. She rushed ahead of them, flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried, \"Now! go in and see for yourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you goose,\" said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the fur coats apart, \"it\\'s just an ordinary wardrobe, look! there\\'s the back of it.\"\\n\\nThen everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw—Lucy herself saw—a perfectly ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it. Peter went in and rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.\\n\\n\"A jolly good hoax, Lu,\" he said as he came out again, \"you have really taken us in, I must admit. We half believed you.\"\\n\\n\"But it wasn\\'t a hoax at all,\" said Lucy, \"really and truly. It was all different a moment ago. Honestly it was. I promise.\"\\n\\n\"Come, Lu,\" said Peter, \"that\\'s going a bit far. You\\'ve had your joke. Hadn\\'t you better drop it now?\"\\n\\nLucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she hardly knew what she was trying to say, and burst into tears.\\n\\nFor the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun. But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right; and she could not bring herself to say this. The others who thought she was telling a lie, and a silly lie too, made her very unhappy. The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and on this occasion he was spiteful. He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she\\'d found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house. What made it worse was that these days ought to have been delightful. The weather was fine and they were out of doors from morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, birds\\' nesting, and lying in the heather. But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it. And so things went on until the next wet day.\\n\\nThat day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather, they decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was \"It\" and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe was. She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business. But she did want to have one more look inside it; for by this time she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream. The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding places that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else. But as soon as she reached it she heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her. She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.\\n\\nNow the steps she had heard were those of Edmund; and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once decided to get into it himself—not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country. He opened the door. There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell of mothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy. \"She thinks I\\'m Susan come to catch her,\" said Edmund to himself, \"and so she\\'s keeping very quiet in at the back.\" He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do. Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He had expected to find her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not. He decided to open the door again and let in some light. But he could not find the door either. He didn\\'t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction; he even shouted out. \"Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know you\\'re here.\"\\n\\nThere was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound—not the sound you expect in a cupboard but a kind of open-air sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw a light.\\n\\n\"Thank goodness,\" said Edmund, \"the door must have swung open of its own accord.\" He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.\\n\\nThere was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees. Overhead there was a pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning. Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear. Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country. There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every direction. He shivered.\\n\\nHe now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her \"imaginary country\" which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted, \"Lucy! Lucy! I\\'m here too—Edmund.\"\\n\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\n\"She\\'s angry about all the things I\\'ve been saying lately,\" thought Edmund. And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong, he also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet place; so he shouted again.\\n\\n\"I say, Lu! I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t believe you. I see now you were right all along. Do come out. Make it Pax.\"\\n\\nStill there was no answer.\\n\\n\"Just like a girl,\" said Edmund to himself, \"sulking somewhere, and won\\'t accept an apology.\" He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place, and had almost made up his mind to go home, when he heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.\\n\\nThe reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them; their branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells. On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high if he had been standing. He was dressed in polar bear\\'s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point; his huge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug. But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person—a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. She also was covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head. Her face was white—not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or icing sugar, except for her very red mouth. It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern.\\n\\nThe sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the Dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" said the Lady, and the Dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down. Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing. In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke.\\n\\n\"And what, pray, are you?\" said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.\\n\\n\"I\\'m—I\\'m—my name\\'s Edmund,\" said Edmund rather awkwardly. He did not like the way she looked at him.\\n\\nThe Lady frowned. \"Is that how you address a Queen?\" she asked, looking sterner than ever.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn\\'t know,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Not know the Queen of Narnia?\" cried she. \"Ha! You shall know us better hereafter. But I repeat—what are you?\"\\n\\n\"Please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I don\\'t know what you mean. I\\'m at school—at least I was—it\\'s the holidays now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTurkish Delight\\n\\n\"But what are you?\" said the Queen again. \"Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard.\"\\n\\n\"No, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I never had a beard, I\\'m a boy.\"\\n\\n\"A boy!\" said she. \"Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?\"\\n\\nEdmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time to understand what the question meant.\\n\\n\"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,\" said the Queen. \"Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?\"\\n\\n\"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.\"\\n\\n\"A wardrobe? What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I—I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. \"A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with.\" As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.\\n\\n\"My poor child,\" she said in quite a different voice, \"how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk.\"\\n\\nEdmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.\\n\\n\"Perhaps something hot to drink?\" said the Queen. \"Should you like that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.\\n\\nThe Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fall from it on to the snow beside the sledge. Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed. The Dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.\\n\\n\"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,\" said the Queen presently. \"What would you like best to eat?\"\\n\\n\"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund.\\n\\nThe Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.\\n\\nWhile he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one\\'s mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming back to it. \"You are sure there are just four of you?\" she asked. \"Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?\" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, \"Yes, I told you that before,\" and forgetting to call her \"Your Majesty\" but she didn\\'t seem to mind now.\\n\\nAt last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him any more. Instead, she said to him,\\n\\n\"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.\\n\\n\"Because, if you did come again—bringing them with you of course—I\\'d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can\\'t do it now, the magic will only work once. In my own house it would be another matter.\"\\n\\n\"Why can\\'t we go to your house now?\" said Edmund. When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back, but he had forgotten about that fear now.\\n\\n\"It is a lovely place, my house,\" said the Queen. \"I am sure you would like it. There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what\\'s more, I have no children of my own. I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I\\'ve ever met. I think I would like to make you the Prince—some day, when you bring the others to visit me.\"\\n\\n\"Why not now?\" said Edmund. His face had become very red and his mouth and fingers were sticky. He did not look either clever or handsome whatever the Queen might say.\\n\\n\"Oh, but if I took you there now,\" said she, \"I shouldn\\'t see your brother and your sisters. I very much want to know your charming relations. You are to be the Prince and—later on—the King; that is understood. But you must have courtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing special about them,\" said Edmund, \"and, anyway, I could always bring them some other time.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but once you were in my house,\" said the Queen, \"you might forget all about them. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn\\'t want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no good coming without them.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t even know the way back to my own country,\" pleaded Edmund.\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy,\" answered the Queen. \"Do you see that lamp?\" She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp-post under which Lucy had met the Faun. \"Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of Men. And now look the other way\"—here she pointed in the opposite direction—\"and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees.\"\\n\\n\"I think I can,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Well my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you have only to find the lamp-post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house. You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it. But remember—you must bring the others with you. I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my best,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"And, by the way,\" said the Queen, \"you needn\\'t tell them about me. It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two, wouldn\\'t it? Make it a surprise for them. Just bring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that—and when you come to my house you could just say \\'Let\\'s see who lives here\\' or something like that. I am sure that would be best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strange stories about me—nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and now—\"\\n\\n\"Please, please,\" said Edmund suddenly, \"please couldn\\'t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home?\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said the Queen with a laugh, \"you must wait till next time.\" While she spoke, she signalled to the Dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund calling out, \"Next time! Next time! Don\\'t forget. Come soon.\"\\n\\nEdmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name, and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood.\\n\\n\"Oh, Edmund!\" she cried. \"So you\\'ve got in too! Isn\\'t it wonderful, and now—\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Edmund, \"I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all. I\\'ll say I\\'m sorry if you like. But where on earth have you been all this time? I\\'ve been looking for you everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"If I\\'d known you had got in I\\'d have waited for you,\" said Lucy who was too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face was. \"I\\'ve been having lunch with dear Mr. Tumnus, the Faun, and he\\'s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can\\'t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all.\"\\n\\n\"The White Witch?\" said Edmund, \"who\\'s she?\"\\n\\n\"She is a perfectly terrible person,\" said Lucy. \"She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarfs and animals—at least all the good ones—simply hate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things. And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia—always winter, but it never gets to Christmas. And she drives about on a sledge, drawn by a reindeer, with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head.\"\\n\\nEdmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.\\n\\n\"Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tumnus, the Faun,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t always believe what Fauns say,\" said Edmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more about them than Lucy.\\n\\n\"Who said so?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Everyone knows it,\" said Edmund, \"ask anybody you like. But it\\'s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow. Let\\'s go home.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, let\\'s,\" said Lucy. \"Oh Edmund, I am glad you\\'ve got in too. The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there. What fun it will be.\"\\n\\nBut Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals; but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He did not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia.\\n\\nBy this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.\\n\\n\"I say,\" said Lucy, \"you do look awful, Edmund. Don\\'t you feel well?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m all right,\" said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.\\n\\n\"Come on then,\" said Lucy, \"let\\'s find the others. What a lot we shall have to tell them! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we\\'re all in it together.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nBack on This Side of the Door\\n\\nBecause the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others. But when at last they were all together (which happened in the long room, where the suit of armour was) Lucy burst out,\\n\\n\"Peter! Susan! It\\'s all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one another in there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s all this about, Ed?\" said Peter.\\n\\nAnd now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he hadn\\'t made up his mind what to do. When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of. He decided to let Lucy down.\\n\\n\"Tell us, Ed,\" said Susan.\\n\\nAnd Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy (there was really only a year\\'s difference) and then a little snigger and said, \"Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing—pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true. Just for fun, of course. There\\'s nothing there really.\"\\n\\nPoor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.\\n\\nEdmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored a great success, and went on at once to say, \"There she goes again. What\\'s the matter with her? That\\'s the worst of young kids, they always—\"\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said Peter turning on him savagely, \"shut up! You\\'ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s all nonsense,\" said Edmund, very taken aback.\\n\\n\"Of course it\\'s all nonsense,\" said Peter, \"that\\'s just the point. Lu was perfectly all right when we left home, but since we\\'ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do you think you\\'ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?\"\\n\\n\"I thought—I thought,\" said Edmund; but he couldn\\'t think of anything to say.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t think anything at all,\" said Peter, \"it\\'s just spite. You\\'ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself; we\\'ve seen that at school before now.\"\\n\\n\"Do stop it,\" said Susan; \"it won\\'t make things any better having a row between you two. Let\\'s go and find Lucy.\"\\n\\nIt was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could see that she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her made any difference. She stuck to her story and said:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care what you think, and I don\\'t care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I\\'ve met a Faun in there and—I wish I\\'d stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts.\"\\n\\nIt was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his plan wasn\\'t working as well as he had expected. The two older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind. They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had gone to bed.\\n\\nThe result was that next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor. \"He\\'ll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu,\" said Peter; \"it\\'s getting beyond us.\" So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said \"Come in,\" and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the whole story. After that he said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected.\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" he asked, \"that your sister\\'s story is not true?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but—\" began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man\\'s face that he was perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together and said, \"But Edmund said they had only been pretending.\"\\n\\n\"That is a point,\" said the Professor, \"which certainly deserves consideration; very careful consideration. For instance—if you will excuse me for asking the question—does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean, which is the more truthful?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just the funny thing about it, Sir,\" said Peter. \"Up till now, I\\'d have said Lucy every time.\"\\n\\n\"And what do you think, my dear?\" said the Professor, turning to Susan.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Susan, \"in general, I\\'d say the same as Peter, but this couldn\\'t be true—all this about the wood and the Faun.\"\\n\\n\"That is more than I know,\" said the Professor, \"and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thing indeed.\"\\n\\n\"We were afraid it mightn\\'t even be lying,\" said Susan. \"We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy.\"\\n\\n\"Madness, you mean?\" said the Professor quite coolly. \"Oh, you can make your minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad.\"\\n\\n\"But then,\" said Susan and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown-up would talk like the Professor and didn\\'t know what to think.\\n\\n\"Logic!\" said the Professor half to himself. \"Why don\\'t they teach logic at these schools? There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth. You know she doesn\\'t tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad. For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.\"\\n\\nSusan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was not making fun of them.\\n\\n\"But how could it be true, Sir?\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"Why do you say that?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"Well, for one thing,\" said Peter, \"if it was real why doesn\\'t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing there when we looked; even Lucy didn\\'t pretend there was.\"\\n\\n\"What has that to do with it?\" said the Professor.\\n\\n\"Well, Sir, if things are real, they\\'re there all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Are they?\" said the Professor; and Peter did not know quite what to say.\\n\\n\"But there was no time,\" said Susan, \"Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was such a place. She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room. It was less than a minute, and she pretended to have been away for hours.\"\\n\\n\"That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,\" said the Professor. \"If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world (and I should warn you that this is a very strange house, and even I know very little about it)—if, I say, she had got into another world, I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of its own; so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time. On the other hand, I don\\'t think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves. If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story.\"\\n\\n\"But do you really mean, Sir,\" said Peter, \"that there could be other worlds—all over the place, just round the corner—like that?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more probable,\" said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, \"I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.\"\\n\\n\"But what are we to do?\" said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point.\\n\\n\"My dear young lady,\" said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them, \"there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"We might all try minding our own business,\" said he. And that was the end of that conversation.\\n\\nAfter this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a rather alarming subject. And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be.\\n\\nThis house of the Professor\\'s—which even he knew so little about—was so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of stories were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now. And when parties of sight-seers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs. Macready, the housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and the rare books in the library. Mrs. Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be interrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew. She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first morning (along with a good many other instructions) \"And please remember you\\'re to keep out of the way whenever I\\'m taking a party over the house.\"\\n\\n\"Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown-ups!\" said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was how the adventures began for the second time.\\n\\nA few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said, \"Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her.\"\\n\\n\"Sharp\\'s the word,\" said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and realised that Mrs. Macready must be bringing her party of sight-seers up the back stairs—instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And after that—whether it was that they lost their heads, or that Mrs. Macready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia—they seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere, until at last Susan said, \"Oh bother those trippers! Here—let\\'s get into the Wardrobe Room till they\\'ve passed. No one will follow us in there.\" But the moment they were inside they heard voices in the passage—and then someone fumbling at the door—and then they saw the handle turning.\\n\\n\"Quick!\" said Peter, \"there\\'s nowhere else,\" and flung open the wardrobe. All four of them bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nInto the Forest\\n\\n\"I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away,\" said Susan presently, \"I\\'m getting horribly cramped.\"\\n\\n\"And what a filthy smell of camphor!\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,\" said Susan, \"to keep away moths.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s something sticking into my back,\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"And isn\\'t it cold?\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Now that you mention it, it is cold,\" said Peter, \"and hang it all, it\\'s wet too. What\\'s the matter with this place? I\\'m sitting on something wet. It\\'s getting wetter every minute.\" He struggled to his feet.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get out,\" said Edmund, \"they\\'ve gone.\"\\n\\n\"O-o-oh!\" said Susan suddenly. And everyone asked her what was the matter.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sitting against a tree,\" said Susan, \"and look! It\\'s getting lighter—over there.\"\\n\\n\"By jove, you\\'re right,\" said Peter, \"and look there—and there. It\\'s trees all round. And this wet stuff is snow. Why, I do believe we\\'ve got into Lucy\\'s wood after all.\"\\n\\nAnd now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow-covered trees.\\n\\nPeter turned at once to Lucy.\\n\\n\"I apologise for not believing you,\" he said, \"I\\'m sorry. Will you shake hands?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Lucy, and did.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Susan, \"what do we do next?\"\\n\\n\"Do?\" said Peter, \"why, go and explore the wood, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Ugh!\" said Susan, stamping her feet, \"it\\'s pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re not ours,\" said Peter doubtfully.\\n\\n\"I am sure nobody would mind,\" said Susan. \"It isn\\'t as if we wanted to take them out of the house; we shan\\'t take them even out of the wardrobe.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought of that, Su,\" said Peter. \"Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe.\"\\n\\nThey immediately carried out Susan\\'s very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get-up and more suitable to the landscape.\\n\\n\"We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending,\" said Peter, as he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.\\n\\n\"I say,\" began Edmund presently, \"oughtn\\'t we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post.\" He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.\\n\\n\"So you really were here,\" he said, \"that time Lu said she\\'d met you in here—and you made out she was telling lies.\"\\n\\nThere was a dead silence. \"Well, of all the poisonous little beasts—\" said Peter and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say and presently the four resumed their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, \"I\\'ll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up, self-satisfied prigs.\"\\n\\n\"Where are we going anyway?\" said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.\\n\\n\"I think Lu ought to be the leader,\" said Peter, \"goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?\"\\n\\n\"What about going to see Mr. Tumnus?\" said Lucy. \"He\\'s the nice Faun I told you about.\"\\n\\nEveryone agreed to this and off they went, walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognised an odd-looking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr. Tumnus\\' cave. But there a terrible surprise awaited them.\\n\\nThe door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun\\'s father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.\\n\\n\"This is a pretty good wash-out,\" said Edmund, \"not much good coming here.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor.\\n\\n\"Is there anything written on it?\" asked Susan.\\n\\n\"Yes, I think there is,\" answered Peter, \"but I can\\'t read it in this light. Let\\'s get out into the open air.\"\\n\\nThey all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words:—\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her said Majesty\\'s enemies, harbouring spies and fraternising with Humans.\\n\\nSigned FENRIS ULF,\\nCaptain of the Secret Police,\\n\\nLONG LIVE THE QUEEN!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe children stared at each other.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that I\\'m going to like this place after all,\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Who is this Queen, Lu?\" said Peter. \"Do you know anything about her?\"\\n\\n\"She isn\\'t a real queen at all,\" answered Lucy, \"she\\'s a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone—all the wood people—hate her. She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"I—I wonder if there\\'s any point in going on,\" said Susan. \"I mean, it doesn\\'t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won\\'t be much fun either. And it\\'s getting colder every minute, and we\\'ve brought nothing to eat. What about just going home?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but we can\\'t, we can\\'t,\" said Lucy suddenly. \"Don\\'t you see? We can\\'t just go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble. He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back. That\\'s what it means by comforting the Queen\\'s enemies and fraternising with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him.\"\\n\\n\"A lot we could do!\" said Edmund, \"when we haven\\'t even got anything to eat!\"\\n\\n\"Shut up—you!\" said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. \"What do you think, Susan?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right,\" said Susan. \"I don\\'t want to go a step further and I wish we\\'d never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr. Whatever-his-name is—I mean the Faun.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I feel too,\" said Peter. \"I\\'m worried about having no food with us. I\\'d vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn\\'t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you\\'ve got out of it. I think we\\'ll have to go on.\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said both the girls.\\n\\n\"If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!\" said Peter.\\n\\nThey were all still, wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, \"Look! There\\'s a robin, with such a red breast. It\\'s the first bird I\\'ve seen here. I say!—I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us.\" Then she turned to the Robin and said, \"Please, can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?\" As she said this she took a step towards the bird. It at once hopped away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard. (You couldn\\'t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.)\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" said Lucy, \"I really believe he means us to follow him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve an idea he does,\" said Susan, \"what do you think, Peter?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we might as well try it,\" answered Peter.\\n\\nThe Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly down hill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch. Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter, \"If you\\'re not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I\\'ve something to say which you\\'d better listen to.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked Peter.\\n\\n\"Hush! Not so loud,\" said Edmund, \"there\\'s no good frightening the girls. But have you realised what we\\'re doing?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.\\n\\n\"We\\'re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why shouldn\\'t it be leading us into a trap?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a nasty idea. Still—a robin you know. They\\'re good birds in all the stories I\\'ve ever read. I\\'m sure a robin wouldn\\'t be on the wrong side.\"\\n\\n\"If it comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the fauns are in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we\\'ve been told she\\'s a witch) is in the wrong? We don\\'t really know anything about either.\"\\n\\n\"The Faun saved Lucy.\"\\n\\n\"He said he did. But how do we know? And there\\'s another thing too. Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here?\"\\n\\n\"Great Scott!\" said Peter, \"I hadn\\'t thought of that.\"\\n\\n\"And no chance of dinner either,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nA Day with the Beavers\\n\\nWhile the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried \"Oh!\" and stopped. \"The robin!\" cried Lucy, \"the robin. It\\'s flown away.\" And so it had—right out of sight.\\n\\n\"And now what are we to do?\" said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much as to say \"What did I tell you?\"\\n\\n\"Sh! Look!\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something moving among the trees—over there to the left.\"\\n\\nThey all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.\\n\\n\"There it goes again,\" said Susan presently.\\n\\n\"I saw it that time too,\" said Peter. \"It\\'s still there. It\\'s just gone behind that big tree.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.\\n\\n\"Whatever it is,\" said Peter, \"it\\'s dodging us. It\\'s something that doesn\\'t want to be seen.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go home,\" said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter. They were lost.\\n\\n\"What\\'s it like?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s—it\\'s a kind of animal,\" said Susan; and then, \"Look! Look! Quick! There it is.\"\\n\\nThey all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree. But this time it didn\\'t immediately draw back. Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their finger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared again. The children all stood holding their breaths.\\n\\nA moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it were afraid someone was watching, said \"Hush,\" made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing, and then once more disappeared.\\n\\n\"I know what it is,\" said Peter, \"it\\'s a beaver. I saw the tail.\"\\n\\n\"It wants us to go to it,\" said Susan, \"and it is warning us not to make a noise.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Peter. \"The question is are we to go to it or not? What do you think, Lu?\"\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a nice beaver,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Yes, but how do we know?\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t we have to risk it?\" said Susan. \"I mean, it\\'s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner.\"\\n\\nAt this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them.\\n\\n\"Come on,\" said Peter, \"let\\'s give it a try. All keep close together. We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.\"\\n\\nSo the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there, sure enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper, \"Further in, come further in. Right in here. We\\'re not safe in the open!\" Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk to them.\\n\\n\"Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?\" it said.\\n\\n\"We\\'re some of them,\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"S-s-s-sh!\" said the Beaver, \"not so loud please. We\\'re not safe even here.\"\\n\\n\"Why, who are you afraid of?\" said Peter. \"There\\'s no one here but ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"There are the trees,\" said the Beaver. \"They\\'re always listening. Most of them are on our side, but there are trees that would betray us to her; you know who I mean,\" and it nodded its head several times.\\n\\n\"If it comes to talking about sides,\" said Edmund, \"how do we know you\\'re a friend?\"\\n\\n\"Not meaning to be rude, Mr. Beaver,\" added Peter, \"but you see, we\\'re strangers.\"\\n\\n\"Quite right, quite right,\" said the Beaver. \"Here is my token.\" With these words it held up to them a little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said, \"Oh, of course. It\\'s my handkerchief—the one I gave to poor Mr. Tumnus.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" said the Beaver. \"Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me. He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to—\" Here the Beaver\\'s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods. Then signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper—\\n\\n\"They say Aslan is on the move—perhaps has already landed.\"\\n\\nAnd now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don\\'t understand but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning—either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in his inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer.\\n\\n\"And what about Mr. Tumnus,\" said Lucy; \"where is he?\"\\n\\n\"S-s-s-sh,\" said the Beaver, \"not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner.\"\\n\\nNo one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the Beaver now and everyone, including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word \"dinner.\" They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour. Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply down hill. A minute later they came out under the open sky (the sun was still shining) and found themselves looking down on a fine sight.\\n\\nThey were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran—at least it would have been running if it hadn\\'t been frozen—a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had been built across this river; and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr. Beaver had made this one. They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face—the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they\\'ve made or reading a story they\\'ve written. So it was only common politeness when Susan said, \"What a lovely dam!\" And Mr. Beaver didn\\'t say \"Hush\" this time but \"Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn\\'t really finished!\"\\n\\nAbove the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now of course a level floor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came. And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on the top of the dam, was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous bee-hive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\n\\nThat was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A little lower down the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it. And looking up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he was almost sure they were the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp-post that other day. And then between them, he thought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less. And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King (\"And I wonder how Peter will like that?\" he asked himself) and horrible ideas came into his head.\\n\\n\"Here we are,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and it looks as if Mrs. Beaver is expecting us. I\\'ll lead the way. But be careful and don\\'t slip.\"\\n\\nThe top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for humans) a very nice place to walk because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr. Beaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it. And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.\\n\\n\"Here we are, Mrs. Beaver,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"I\\'ve found them. Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve\"—and they all went in.\\n\\nThe first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the first thing she saw was a kind-looking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine and it was from it that the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon as the children came in.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ve come at last!\" she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws. \"At last! To think that ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle\\'s singing and I daresay, Mr. Beaver, you\\'ll get us some fish.\"\\n\\n\"That I will,\" said Mr. Beaver and he went out of the house (Peter went with him) and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet. They took a pail with them, Mr. Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole (he didn\\'t seem to mind it\\'s being so chilly) looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his paw, and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout. Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish.\\n\\nMeanwhile the girls were helping Mrs. Beaver to fill the the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr. Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr. Tumnus\\'s cave. There were no books or pictures and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall. And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof and against the walls were gum boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fishing rods and fishing nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table tho\\' very clean was very rough.\\n\\nJust as the frying pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr. Beaver came in with the fish which Mr. Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good the new-caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mrs. Beaver said, \"Now we\\'re nearly ready.\" Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs. Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few minutes everyone was drawing up stools (it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers\\' house except for Mrs. Beaver\\'s own special rocking chair beside the fire) and preparing to enjoy themselves. There was a jug of creamy milk for the children (Mr. Beaver stuck to beer) and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes and all the children thought—and I agree with them—that there\\'s nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish Mrs. Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the kettle on to the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to be poured out. And when each person had got his (or her) cup of tea, each person shoved back his (or her) stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Beaver pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him, \"if you\\'ll just wait till I\\'ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely—why, now we can get to business. It\\'s snowing again,\" he added, cocking his eye at the window. \"That\\'s all the better, because it means we shan\\'t have any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why he won\\'t find any tracks.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nWhat Happened after Dinner\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Lucy, \"do please tell us what\\'s happened to Mr. Tumnus.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s bad,\" said Mr. Beaver shaking his head. \"That\\'s a very, very bad business. There\\'s no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done.\"\\n\\n\"But where\\'s he been taken to?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means.\"\\n\\n\"No, we don\\'t,\" said Susan. But Mr. Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it means they were taking him to her house,\" said Mr. Beaver.\\n\\n\"But what\\'ll they do to him, Mr. Beaver?\" gasped Lucy.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"you can\\'t exactly say for sure. But there\\'s not many taken in there that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is—in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall. People she\\'s turned—\" (he paused and shuddered) \"turned into stone.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mr. Beaver,\" said Lucy, \"can\\'t we—I mean we must do something to save him. It\\'s too dreadful and it\\'s all on my account.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt you\\'d save him if you could, dearie,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"but you\\'ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t we have some stratagem?\" said Peter. \"I mean couldn\\'t we dress up as something, or pretend to be—oh, pedlars or anything—or watch till she was gone out—or—oh, hang it all, there must be some way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr. Beaver. We can\\'t just leave him to be—to be—to have that done to him.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good, Son of Adam,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"no good your trying, of all people. But now that Aslan is on the move—\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!\" said several voices at once; for once again that strange feeling—like the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.\\n\\n\"Who is Aslan?\" asked Susan.\\n\\n\"Aslan?\" said Mr. Beaver, \"Why don\\'t you know? He\\'s the King. He\\'s the Lord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in my time or my father\\'s time. But the word has reached us that he has come back. He is in Narnia at this moment. He\\'ll settle the White Queen all right. It is he, not you, that will save Mr. Tumnus.\"\\n\\n\"She won\\'t turn him into stone too?\" said Edmund.\\n\\n\"Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!\" answered Mr. Beaver with a great laugh. \"Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it\\'ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He\\'ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:—\\n\\nWrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,\\nAt the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,\\nWhen he bares his teeth, winter meets its death\\nAnd when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.\\n\\nYou\\'ll understand when you see him.\"\\n\\n\"But shall we see him?\" asked Susan.\\n\\n\"Why, Daughter of Eve, that\\'s what I brought you here for. I\\'m to lead you where you shall meet him,\" said Mr. Beaver.\\n\\n\"Is—is he a man?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Aslan a man!\" said Mr. Beaver sternly. \"Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea. Don\\'t you know who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion—the Lion, the great Lion.\"\\n\\n\"Ooh!\" said Susan, \"I\\'d thought he was a man. Is he—quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.\"\\n\\n\"That you will, dearie, and no mistake,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"if there\\'s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they\\'re either braver than most or else just silly.\"\\n\\n\"Then he isn\\'t safe?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Safe?\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Don\\'t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \\'Course he isn\\'t safe. But he\\'s good. He\\'s the King, I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m longing to see him,\" said Peter, \"even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, Son of Adam,\" said Mr. Beaver bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. \"And so you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him, to-morrow if you can, at the Stone Table.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s that?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll show you,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"It\\'s down the river, a good step from here. I\\'ll take you to it!\"\\n\\n\"But meanwhile what about poor Mr. Tumnus?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"once he\\'s with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we don\\'t need you too. For that\\'s another of the old rhymes:—\\n\\nWhen Adam\\'s flesh and Adam\\'s bone\\nSits at Cair Paravel in throne,\\nThe evil time will be over and done.\\n\\nSo things must be drawing near their end now he\\'s come and you\\'ve come. We\\'ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before—long ago, nobody can say when. But there\\'s never been any of your race here before.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I don\\'t understand, Mr. Beaver,\" said Peter, \"I mean isn\\'t the Witch herself human?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'d like us to believe it,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and it\\'s on that that she bases her claim to be Queen. But she\\'s no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam\\'s—\" (here Mr. Beaver bowed) \"your father Adam\\'s first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That\\'s what she comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn\\'t a drop of real Human blood in the Witch.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why she\\'s bad all through, Mr. Beaver,\" said Mrs. Beaver.\\n\\n\"True enough, Mrs. Beaver,\" replied he, \"there may be two views about Humans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there\\'s no two views about things that look like Humans and aren\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve known good dwarfs,\" said Mrs. Beaver.\\n\\n\"So\\'ve I, now you come to speak of it,\" said her husband, \"but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that\\'s going to be Human and isn\\'t yet, or used to be Human once and isn\\'t now, or ought to be Human and isn\\'t, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that\\'s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia. She\\'s been watching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she\\'d be more dangerous still.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that to do with it?\" asked Peter.\\n\\n\"Because of another prophecy,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Down at Cair Paravel—that\\'s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be—down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it\\'s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch\\'s reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn\\'t be worth a shake of my whiskers!\"\\n\\nAll the children had been attending so hard to what Mr. Beaver was telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:\\n\\n\"I say—where\\'s Edmund?\"\\n\\nThere was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking \"Who saw him last? How long has he been missing? Is he outside?\" And then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction. \"Edmund! Edmund!\" they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.\\n\\n\"How perfectly dreadful!\" said Susan as they at last came back in despair. \"Oh, how I wish we\\'d never come.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth are we to do, Mr. Beaver?\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"Do?\" said Mr. Beaver who was already putting on his snow boots, \"do? We must be off at once. We haven\\'t a moment to spare!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'d better divide into four search parties,\" said Peter, \"and all go in different directions. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and—\"\\n\\n\"Search parties, Son of Adam?\" said Mr. Beaver; \"what for?\"\\n\\n\"Why, to look for Edmund of course!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no point in looking for him,\" said Mr. Beaver.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Susan, \"he can\\'t be far away yet. And we\\'ve got to find him. What do you mean when you say there\\'s no use looking for him?\"\\n\\n\"The reason there\\'s no use looking,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"is that we know already where he\\'s gone!\" Everyone stared in amazement. \"Don\\'t you understand?\" said Mr. Beaver. \"He\\'s gone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh surely—oh really!\" said Susan, \"he can\\'t have done that.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t he?\" said Mr. Beaver looking very hard at the three children, and everything they wanted to say died on their lips for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.\\n\\n\"But will he know the way?\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"Has he been in this country before?\" asked Mr. Beaver, \"has he ever been here alone?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Lucy almost in a whisper, \"I\\'m afraid he has.\"\\n\\n\"And did he tell you what he\\'d done or who he\\'d met?\"\\n\\n\"Well, no, he didn\\'t,\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"Then mark my words,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"he has already met the White Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn\\'t like to mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself \\'Treacherous.\\' He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you\\'ve lived long in Narnia, something about their eyes.\"\\n\\n\"All the same,\" said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, \"we\\'ll still have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast, and he\\'s only a kid.\"\\n\\n\"Go to the Witch\\'s house?\" said Mrs. Beaver. \"Don\\'t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Why all she wants is to get all four of you (she\\'s thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done—and there\\'d be four new statues in her collection before you\\'d had time to speak. But she\\'ll keep him alive as long as he\\'s the only one she\\'s got, because she\\'ll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, can no one help us?\" wailed Lucy.\\n\\n\"Only Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"we must go on and meet him. That\\'s our only chance now.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"that it is very important to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won\\'t know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan—\" began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, he was,\" she said miserably; \"don\\'t you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn\\'t turn Aslan into stone too?\"\\n\\n\"So he did, by Jove,\" said Peter, \"just the sort of thing he would say, too!\"\\n\\n\"Worse and worse,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?\"\\n\\nAnd of course no one knew the answer to this question.\\n\\n\"Because, if he was,\" continued Mr. Beaver, \"then she\\'ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan.\"\\n\\n\"But that isn\\'t what she\\'ll do first,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"not if I know her. The moment that Edmund tells her that we\\'re all here she\\'ll set out to catch us this very night, and if he\\'s been gone about half an hour, she\\'ll be here in about another twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right, Mrs. Beaver,\" said her husband, \"we must all get away from here. There\\'s not a moment to lose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nIn the Witch\\'s House\\n\\nAnd now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn\\'t really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight—and there\\'s nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food. And he had heard the conversation and hadn\\'t enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder. They weren\\'t, but he imagined it. And then he had listened until Mr. Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling.\\n\\nJust as Mr. Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam\\'s flesh and Adam\\'s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door handle; and just before Mr. Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn\\'t really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.\\n\\nYou mustn\\'t think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn\\'t want her to be particularly nice to them—certainly not to put them on the same level as himself—but he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn\\'t do anything very bad to them, \"Because,\" he said to himself, \"all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn\\'t true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she is the rightful Queen really. Anyway, she\\'ll be better than that awful Aslan!\" At least, that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn\\'t a very good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.\\n\\nThe first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all around him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers\\' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now. The next thing he realised was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly three o\\'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn\\'t reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn\\'t so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.\\n\\nIt was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too there was no road. He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others, if he hadn\\'t happened to say to himself, \"When I\\'m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads.\" And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as bright as day—only the shadows were rather confusing.\\n\\nHe would never have found his way if the moon hadn\\'t come out by the time he got to the other river—you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at the Beavers\\') a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop to go under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back. And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter—just as if all this had been Peter\\'s fault.\\n\\nBut at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch\\'s house. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The house was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce\\'s caps or sorcerer\\'s caps. And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow! Edmund began to be afraid of the house.\\n\\nBut it was too late to think of turning back now. He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the house. There was nothing stirring; not the slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the house, and past turret after turret to find the door. He had to go right round to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open.\\n\\nEdmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don\\'t know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.\\n\\nThen at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still—for it hadn\\'t moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could. He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn\\'t have been looking at him at all. (\"But supposing it turns its head?\" thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring at something else—namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away. \"Aha!\" thought Edmund. \"When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape.\" But still the lion never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion\\'s back and the top of its head were covered with snow. Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now he hardly dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It was cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!\\n\\nThe relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea. \"Probably,\" he thought, \"this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She\\'s caught him already and turned him into stone. So that\\'s the end of all their fine ideas about him! Pooh! Who\\'s afraid of Aslan?\"\\n\\nAnd he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion\\'s upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, \"Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn\\'t you?\" But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight that Edmund didn\\'t really get any fun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.\\n\\nAs he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about—standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess board when it is half way through the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-a-mountains of stone. There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon. They all looked so strange standing there perfectly lifelike and also perfectly still, in the bright cold moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like going past it.\\n\\nHe now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard. He went to it, there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door. Edmund went up them. Across the threshold lay a great wolf:\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, it\\'s all right,\" he kept saying to himself, \"it\\'s only a stone wolf. It can\\'t hurt me,\" and he raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back, opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice,\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there? Who\\'s there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, Sir,\" said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak, \"my name is Edmund, and I\\'m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I\\'ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia—quite close, in the Beavers\\' house. She—she wanted to see them.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell Her Majesty,\" said the Wolf. \"Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as you value your life.\" Then it vanished into the house.\\n\\nEdmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest, and presently the grey Wolf, Fenris Ulf, the Chief of the Witch\\'s Secret Police, came bounding back and said, \"Come in! Come in! Fortunate favourite of the Queen—or else not so fortunate.\"\\n\\nAnd Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf\\'s paws.\\n\\nHe found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the courtyard had been, of statues. The one nearest the door was a little Faun with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn\\'t help wondering if this might be Lucy\\'s friend. The only light came from a single lamp and close behind this sat the White Witch.\\n\\n\"I\\'m come, your Majesty,\" said Edmund rushing eagerly forward.\\n\\n\"How dare you come alone?\" said the Witch in a terrible voice. \"Did I not tell you to bring the others with you?\"\\n\\n\"Please, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, \"I\\'ve done the best I can. I\\'ve brought them quite close. They\\'re in the little house on top of the dam just up the river—with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.\"\\n\\nA slow cruel smile came over the Witch\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Is this all your news?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"No, your Majesty,\" said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers\\' house.\\n\\n\"What! Aslan?\" cried the Queen, \"Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have lied to me—\"\\n\\n\"Please, I\\'m only repeating what they said,\" stammered Edmund.\\n\\nBut the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands. Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.\\n\\n\"Make ready our sledge,\" ordered the Witch, \"and use the harness without bells.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nThe Spell Begins to Break\\n\\nNow we must go back to Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr. Beaver said \"There\\'s no time to lose\" everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs. Beaver who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: \"Now, Mr. Beaver, just reach down that ham. And here\\'s a packet of tea, and there\\'s sugar, and some matches. And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner.\"\\n\\n\"What are you doing, Mrs. Beaver?\" exclaimed Susan.\\n\\n\"Packing a load for each of us, dearie,\" said Mrs. Beaver very coolly. \"You didn\\'t think we\\'d set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?\"\\n\\n\"But we haven\\'t time!\" said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat. \"She may be here any minute.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I say,\" chimed in Mr. Beaver.\\n\\n\"Get along with you all,\" said his wife. \"Think it over, Mr. Beaver. She can\\'t be here for a quarter of an hour at least.\"\\n\\n\"But don\\'t we want as big a start as we can possibly get,\" said Peter, \"if we\\'re to reach the Stone Table before her?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to remember that, Mrs. Beaver,\" said Susan. \"As soon as she has looked in here and finds we\\'re gone she\\'ll be off at top speed.\"\\n\\n\"That she will,\" said Mrs. Beaver. \"But we can\\'t get there before her whatever we do, for she\\'ll be on a sledge and we\\'ll be walking.\"\\n\\n\"Then—have we no hope?\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t you get fussing, there\\'s a dear,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of that drawer. \\'Course we\\'ve got a hope. We can\\'t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she won\\'t expect and perhaps we\\'ll get through.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true enough, Mrs. Beaver,\" said her husband. \"But it\\'s time we were out of this.\"\\n\\n\"And don\\'t you start fussing either, Mr. Beaver,\" said his wife. \"There. That\\'s better. There\\'s four loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that\\'s you, my dear,\" she added looking at Lucy.\\n\\n\"Oh, do please come on,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m nearly ready now,\" answered Mrs. Beaver at last allowing her husband to help her into her snow boots. \"I suppose the sewing machine\\'s too heavy to bring?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. It is,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"A great deal too heavy. And you don\\'t think you\\'ll be able to use it while we\\'re on the run, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it,\" said Mrs. Beaver, \"and breaking it or stealing it, as likely as not.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!\" said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and Mr. Beaver locked the door (\"It\\'ll delay her a bit,\" he said) and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.\\n\\nThe snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in single file—first Mr. Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs. Beaver last of all. Mr. Beaver led them across the dam and onto the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above them on either hand. \"Best keep down here as much as possible,\" he said. \"She\\'ll have to keep to the top, for you couldn\\'t bring a sledge down here.\"\\n\\nIt would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking—and walking—and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr. Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr. Beaver had turned away from the river bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr. Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she realised what was happening, only his short flat tail was showing.\\n\\nLucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside.\\n\\n\"Wherever is this?\" said Peter\\'s voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. (I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)\\n\\n\"It\\'s an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times,\" said Mr. Beaver, \"and a great secret. It\\'s not much of a place but we must get a few hours\\' sleep.\"\\n\\n\"If you hadn\\'t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I\\'d have brought some pillows,\" said Mrs. Beaver.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t nearly such a nice cave as Mr. Tumnus\\'s, Lucy thought—just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of fur and clothes together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs. Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something—it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you\\'d swallowed it—and everyone went straight to sleep.\\n\\nIt seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hours later) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave. But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open, listening to a sound which was the very sound they\\'d all been thinking of (and sometimes imagining they heard) during their walk last night. It was a sound of jingling bells.\\n\\nMr. Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it. Perhaps you think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing for him to do? But it was really a very sensible one. He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch\\'s sledge went. The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering. They waited nearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened them very much. They heard voices. \"Oh,\" thought Lucy, \"he\\'s been seen. She\\'s caught him!\"\\n\\nGreat was their surprise when, a little later, they heard Mr. Beaver\\'s voice calling to them from just outside the cave.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" he was shouting. \"Come out, Mrs. Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve. It\\'s all right! It isn\\'t her!\" This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia—in our world they usually don\\'t talk at all.\\n\\nSo Mrs. Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinking in the daylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" cried Mr. Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight. \"Come and see! This is a nasty knock for the Witch! It looks as if her power was already crumbling.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Beaver?\" panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you,\" answered Mr. Beaver, \"that she\\'d made it always winter and never Christmas? Didn\\'t I tell you? Well, just come and see!\"\\n\\nAnd then they were all at the top and did see.\\n\\nIt was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they were far bigger than the Witch\\'s reindeer, and they were not white but brown. And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him. He was a huge man in a bright red robe (bright as holly-berries) with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest. Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world—the world on this side of the wardrobe door. But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different. Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly. But now that the children actually stood looking at him they didn\\'t find it quite like that. He was so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became quite still. They felt very glad, but also solemn.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve come at last,\" said he. \"She has kept me out for a long time, but I have got in at last. Aslan is on the move. The Witch\\'s magic is weakening.\"\\n\\nAnd Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Father Christmas, \"for your presents. There is a new and better sewing machine for you, Mrs. Beaver. I will drop it in your house as I pass.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Mrs. Beaver, making a curtsey. \"It\\'s locked up.\"\\n\\n\"Locks and bolts make no difference to me,\" said Father Christmas. \"And as for you, Mr. Beaver, when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice gate fitted.\"\\n\\nMr. Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn\\'t say anything at all.\\n\\n\"Peter, Adam\\'s Son,\" said Father Christmas.\\n\\n\"Here, Sir,\" said Peter.\\n\\n\"These are your presents,\" was the answer, \"and they are tools not toys. The time to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.\" With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.\\n\\n\"Susan, Eve\\'s Daughter,\" said Father Christmas. \"These are for you,\" and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. \"You must use the bow only in great need,\" he said, \"for I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you.\"\\n\\nLast of all he said, \"Lucy, Eve\\'s Daughter,\" and Lucy came forward. He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond) and a small dagger. \"In this bottle,\" he said, \"there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire-flowers that grow in the mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends are hurt, a few drops of this will restore you. And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need. For you also are not to be in the battle.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Sir,\" said Lucy. \"I think—I don\\'t know—but I think I could be brave enough.\"\\n\\n\"That is not the point,\" he said. \"But battles are ugly when women fight. And now\"—here he suddenly looked less grave—\"here is something for the moment for you all!\" and he brought out (I suppose from the big bag at his back, but nobody quite saw him do it) a large tray containing five cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot. Then he cried out \"A Merry Christmas! Long live the true King!\" and cracked his whip and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started.\\n\\nPeter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr. Beaver when Mrs. Beaver said:\\n\\n\"Now then, now then! Don\\'t stand talking there till the tea\\'s got cold. Just like men. Come and help to carry the tray down and we\\'ll have breakfast. What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife.\"\\n\\nSo down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr. Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs. Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed himself. But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr. Beaver said, \"Time to be moving on now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nAslan Is Nearer\\n\\nEdmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the Dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting. But she said nothing at all. And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say, \"Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight? You—you—said—\" she answered, \"Silence, fool!\" Then she appeared to change her mind and said, as if to herself, \"And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way,\" and once more clapped her hands. Another dwarf appeared. \"Bring the human creature food and drink,\" she said. The Dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned in a repulsive manner as he set them down the floor beside Edmund and said:\\n\\n\"Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!\"\\n\\n\"Take it away,\" said Edmund sulkily. \"I don\\'t want dry bread.\" But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologised and began to nibble at the bread, though it was so stale he could hardly get it down.\\n\\n\"You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,\" said the Witch.\\n\\nWhile he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her. The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge. But before they drove off she called Fenris Ulf and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.\\n\\n\"Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers,\" said the Witch, \"and kill whatever you find there. If they are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen. Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river. You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do if you find them!\"\\n\\n\"I hear and obey, O Queen,\" growled the Wolf; and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam and sniffing at the Beavers\\' house. But of course they found it empty. It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine, for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail—and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Dwarf whipped up the reindeer and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund who had no coat. Before they had been going a quarter of ah hour all the front of him was covered with snow—he soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was wet to the skin. And oh, how miserable he was. It didn\\'t look now as if the Witch intended to make him a King! All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now. He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment—even Peter! The only way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he might wake up at any moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like a dream.\\n\\nThis lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight. And still they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer\\'s harness. And then at last the Witch said, \"What have we here? Stop!\" and they did.\\n\\nHow Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast! But she had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dog-fox, all on stools round a table. Edmund couldn\\'t quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn\\'t at all sure that he didn\\'t see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something. But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half-way to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squealed with terror.\\n\\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.\\n\\n\"Speak, vermin!\" she said again. \"Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip? What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste, this self indulgence? Where did you get all these things?\"\\n\\n\"Please, your Majesty,\" said the Fox, \"we were given them. And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty\\'s very good health—\"\\n\\n\"Who gave them to you?\" said the Witch.\\n\\n\"F-F-F-Father Christmas,\" stammered the Fox.\\n\\n\"What?\" roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer to the terrified animals. \"He has not been here! He cannot have been here! How dare you—but no. Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven.\"\\n\\nAt that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.\\n\\n\"He has—he has—he has!\" it squeaked beating its little spoon on the table. Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek. Then she raised her wand. \"Oh don\\'t, don\\'t, please don\\'t,\" shouted Edmund, but even while he was shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures (one with its stone fork fixed forever half-way to its stone mouth) seated round a stone table on which there were stone plates and a stone plum pudding.\\n\\n\"As for you,\" said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re-mounted the sledge, \"let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!\" And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces crumbled away.\\n\\nNow they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night. At the same time he noticed that he was feeling much less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every minute it grew both foggier and warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up till now. At first he thought this was because the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn\\'t be the real reason. The sledge jerked, and skidded, and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones. And however the Dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower. There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them but the noise of their driving and jolting and the Dwarf\\'s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn\\'t go on at all. When that happened there was a moment\\'s silence. And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling, chattering noise—and yet not so strange, for he knew he\\'d heard it before—if only he could remember where! Then all at once he did remember. It was the noise of running water. All round them, though out of sight, there were streams chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the distance) roaring. And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew why) when he realised that the frost was over. And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from the branches of all the trees. And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree. But he hadn\\'t time to listen or watch any longer for the Witch said:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t sit staring, fool! Get out and help.\"\\n\\nAnd of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow—but it was really only slush by now—and began helping the Dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into. They got it out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the Dwarf managed to get it on the move again, and they drove a little further. And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good, your Majesty,\" said the Dwarf. \"We can\\'t sledge in this thaw.\"\\n\\n\"Then we must walk,\" said the Witch.\\n\\n\"We shall never overtake them walking,\" growled the dwarf. \"Not with the start they\\'ve got.\"\\n\\n\"Are you my councillor or my slave?\" said the Witch. \"Do as you\\'re told. Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope. And take your whip. And cut the harness of the reindeer; they\\'ll find their own way home.\"\\n\\nThe Dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass, and every time he slipped the Dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip. The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying, \"Faster! Faster!\"\\n\\nEvery moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of snow grew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow. Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether. Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree-tops.\\n\\nSoon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers—celandines. The noise of water grew louder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it they found snowdrops growing.\\n\\n\"Mind your own business!\" said the Dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them; and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.\\n\\nBut of course this didn\\'t prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree—gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds\\' music, and wherever Edmund\\'s eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or having their little quarrels.\\n\\n\"Faster! Faster!\" said the Witch.\\n\\nThere was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travellers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves. As the travellers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed across their path.\\n\\n\"This is no thaw,\" said the Dwarf, suddenly stopping. \"This is spring. What are we to do? Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan\\'s doing.\"\\n\\n\"If either of you mention that name again,\" said the Witch, \"he shall instantly be killed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nPeter\\'s First Battle\\n\\nWhile the Dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beaver and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind them. And by now they had even stopped saying to one another, \"Look! There\\'s a kingfisher!\" or \"I say, bluebells!\" or \"What was that lovely smell?\" or \"Just listen to that thrush!\" They walked on in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses of flowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering.\\n\\nThey had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn\\'t even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch\\'s schemes. And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge. After that they didn\\'t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones. They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I\\'d call bitterly tired—only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.\\n\\nThey had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn a little to the right (that meant a little to the South) to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way, they couldn\\'t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood—a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood—and their path would have been under water.\\n\\nAnd now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the flowers began to think about closing.\\n\\n\"Not long now,\" said Mr. Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep, springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly they were at the top. And this is what they saw.\\n\\nThey were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction—except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. \"By gum!\" whispered Peter to Susan. \"The sea!\" In the very middle of this open hilltop was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language. They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was—and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it—with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner, which bore a red rampant lion, fluttered in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.\\n\\nAslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves around him in the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.\\n\\nBut as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn\\'t know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan\\'s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn\\'t look at him and went all trembly.\\n\\n\"Go on,\" whispered Mr. Beaver.\\n\\n\"No,\" whispered Peter, \"you first.\"\\n\\n\"No, Sons of Adam before animals,\" whispered Mr. Beaver back again.\\n\\n\"Susan,\" whispered Peter, \"what about you? Ladies first.\"\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re the eldest,\" whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realised that it was up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others \"Come on. Pull yourselves together,\" he advanced to the Lion and said:\\n\\n\"We have come—Aslan.\"\\n\\n\"Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,\" said Aslan. \"Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.\"\\n\\nHis voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. They now felt glad and quiet and it didn\\'t seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing.\\n\\n\"But where is the fourth?\" asked Aslan.\\n\\n\"He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,\" said Mr. Beaver. And then something made Peter say:\\n\\n\"That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong.\"\\n\\nAnd Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great golden eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said.\\n\\n\"Please—Aslan,\" said Lucy, \"can anything be done to save Edmund?\"\\n\\n\"All shall be done,\" said Aslan. \"But it may be harder than you think.\" And then he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked; now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well. But next minute that expression was quite gone. The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paws together (\"Terrible paws,\" thought Lucy, \"If he didn\\'t know how to velvet them!\") and said:\\n\\n\"Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them.\"\\n\\nWhen the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw—and though it was velveted it was very heavy—on Peter\\'s shoulder and said, \"Come, Son of Adam, and I will show you a far-off sight of the castle where you are to be King.\"\\n\\nAnd Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hill-top. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs. That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light—forest and hills and valleys and, winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. And beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset. But just where the land of Narnia met the sea—in fact, at the mouth of the great river—there was something on a little hill, shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was reflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore.\\n\\n\"That, O Man,\" said Aslan, \"is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one of which you must sit as King. I show it to you because you are the first-born and you will be High King over all the rest.\"\\n\\nAnd once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.\\n\\n\"It is your sister\\'s horn,\" said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to be almost a purr, if it is not disrespectful to think of a lion purring.\\n\\nFor a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the other creatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw, \"Back! Let the Prince win his spurs,\" he did understand, and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion. And there he saw a dreadful sight.\\n\\nThe Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper. Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast. At first Peter thought it was a bear. Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog. Then he realised that it was a wolf—a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk snapping and snarling. All the hair on its back stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch. One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snapping teeth. Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip; then he realised that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.\\n\\nPeter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made no difference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side. That stroke never reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once. As it was—though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all—he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the brute\\'s forelegs into its heart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes. He felt tired all over.\\n\\nThen, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won\\'t say there wasn\\'t kissing and crying on both sides. But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that.\\n\\n\"Quick! Quick!\" shouted the voice of Aslan, \"Centaurs! Eagles! I see another wolf in the thickets. There—behind you. He has just darted away. After him, all of you! He will be going to his mistress. Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.\" And instantly with a thunder of hoofs and a beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness.\\n\\nPeter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.\\n\\n\"You have forgotten to clean your sword,\" said Aslan.\\n\\nIt was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf\\'s hair and blood. He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on his coat.\\n\\n\"Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,\" said Aslan. And when Peter had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said, \"Rise up, Sir Peter Fenris-Bane. And, whatever happens, never forget to wipe your sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nDeep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\n\\nNow we must go back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face, doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was. The Witch and the Dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Dwarf, \"it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reached the Stone Table by now.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,\" said the Witch.\\n\\n\"It cannot be good news if he does,\" said the Dwarf.\\n\\n\"Four thrones in Cair Paravel,\" said the Witch. \"How if only three were filled? That would not fulfil the prophecy.\"\\n\\n\"What difference would that make now that he is here?\" said the Dwarf. He did not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.\\n\\n\"He may not stay long. And then—we would fall upon the three at Cair.\"\\n\\n\"Yet it might be better,\" said the Dwarf, \"to keep this one\" (here he kicked Edmund) \"for bargaining with.\"\\n\\n\"Yes! And have him rescued,\" said the Witch scornfully.\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the Dwarf, \"we had better do what we have to do at once.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself,\" said the Witch. \"That is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.\"\\n\\n\"It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use,\" said the Dwarf.\\n\\n\"True,\" said the Witch; and then, \"Well, I will begin.\"\\n\\nAt that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.\\n\\n\"I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with him. They have killed my captain, Fenris Ulf. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One of the Sons of Adam killed him. Fly! Fly!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Witch. \"There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can. Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side. Call the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels, the Hags, the Spectres, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight. What? Have I not still my wand? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on? Be off quickly, I have a little thing to finish here while you are away.\"\\n\\nThe great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.\\n\\n\"Now!\" said she, \"we have no table—let me see. We had better put it against the trunk of a tree.\"\\n\\nEdmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the Dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white. Because they were so very white he could not see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.\\n\\n\"Prepare the victim,\" said the Witch. And the Dwarf undid Edmund\\'s collar and folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund\\'s hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund heard a strange noise—whizz—whizz—whizz. For a moment he couldn\\'t think what it was. Then he realised. It was the sound of a knife being sharpened!\\n\\nAt that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction—a drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings—a scream from the Witch—confusion all round him. And then he found he was being untied. Strong arms were round him and he heard big, kind voices saying things like \"Let him lie down—give him some wine—drink this—steady now—you\\'ll be all right in a minute.\"\\n\\nThen he heard the voices of people who were talking not to him but to one another. And they were saying things like \"Who\\'s got the Witch?—I thought you had her—I didn\\'t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand—I was after the Dwarf—Do you mean to say she\\'s escaped?—A chap can\\'t mind everything at once—What\\'s that? Oh sorry it\\'s only an old stump!\" But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint.\\n\\nPresently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think they might have been surprised.\\n\\nIt was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright, if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump and on a fair sized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground. And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the Dwarf. For it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they weren\\'t, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept hold of her wand also, so it had been kept safe, too.\\n\\nWhen the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard—from Mrs. Beaver—was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had breakfasted they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is no need to tell you (and no one ever heard) what Aslan was saying but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them bringing Edmund with him.\\n\\n\"Here is your brother,\" he said, \"and—there is no need to talk to him about what is past.\"\\n\\nEdmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn, \"I\\'m sorry,\" and everyone said \"That\\'s all right.\" And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friends with him again—something ordinary and natural—and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said:\\n\\n\"Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.\"\\n\\n\"Let him approach,\" said Aslan.\\n\\nThe leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch\\'s Dwarf.\\n\\n\"What is your message, Son of Earth?\" asked Aslan.\\n\\n\"The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you,\" said the Dwarf, \"on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers.\"\\n\\n\"Queen of Narnia, indeed!\" said Mr. Beaver. \"Of all the cheek—\"\\n\\n\"Peace, Beaver,\" said Aslan. \"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Tell your mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak.\"\\n\\nThis was agreed to and two leopards went back with the Dwarf to see that the conditions were properly carried out. \"But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone?\" whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea had occurred to the leopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling—like a cat\\'s when it sees a strange dog.\\n\\n\"It\\'ll be all right,\" whispered Peter in reply. \"He wouldn\\'t send them if it weren\\'t.\"\\n\\nA few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children, who had not seen her before, felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face; and there were low growls among all the animals present. Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces—the golden face and the dead-white face—so close together. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs. Beaver particularly noticed this.\\n\\n\"You have a traitor there, Aslan,\" said the Witch. Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he\\'d been through and after the talk he\\'d had that morning. He just went on looking at Aslan. It didn\\'t seem to matter what the Witch said.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Aslan. \"His offence was not against you.\"\\n\\n\"Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?\" asked the Witch.\\n\\n\"Let us say I have forgotten it,\" answered Aslan gravely. \"Tell us of this Deep Magic.\"\\n\\n\"Tell you?\" said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller. \"Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea? You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Beaver. \"So that\\'s how you came to imagine yourself a Queen—because you were the Emperor\\'s hangman. I see.\"\\n\\n\"Peace, Beaver,\" said Aslan, with a very low growl.\\n\\n\"And so,\" continued the Witch, \"that human creature is mine. His life is forfeit to me. His blood is my property.\"\\n\\n\"Come and take it then,\" said the Bull with the man\\'s head in a great bellowing voice.\\n\\n\"Fool,\" said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, \"do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force? He knows the Deep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.\"\\n\\n\"It is very true,\" said Aslan; \"I do not deny it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Aslan!\" whispered Susan in the Lion\\'s ear, \"can\\'t we—I mean, you won\\'t, will you? Can\\'t we do something about the Deep Magic? Isn\\'t there something you can work against it?\"\\n\\n\"Work against the Emperor\\'s magic?\" said Aslan turning to her with something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again.\\n\\nEdmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan\\'s face. He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something; but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to wait, and do what he was told.\\n\\n\"Fall back, all of you,\" said Aslan, \"and I will talk to the Witch alone.\"\\n\\nThey all obeyed. It was a terrible time this—waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy said, \"Oh, Edmund!\" and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other\\'s paws with their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs. But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble bee flying past, or the birds in the forest down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on.\\n\\nAt last they heard Aslan\\'s voice. \"You can all come back,\" he said. \"I have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother\\'s blood.\" And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding his breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of talk. They began to come back to Aslan\\'s throne.\\n\\nThe Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said,\\n\\n\"But how do I know this promise will be kept?\"\\n\\n\"Wow!\" roared Aslan half rising from his throne; and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nThe Triumph of the Witch\\n\\nAs soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said, \"We must move from this place at once, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall encamp to-night at the Fords of Beruna.\"\\n\\nOf course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the Witch; but his face was stern and everyone\\'s ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared.\\n\\nAfter a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass) they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o\\'clock they were on the march and set off in a North-Westerly direction, walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go.\\n\\nDuring the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign. \"As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,\" he said, \"the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it.\" He then went on to outline two plans of battle—one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the operations, saying things like, \"You must put your centaurs in such and such a place\" or \"You must post scouts to see that she doesn\\'t do so-and-so,\" till at last Peter said,\\n\\n\"But you will be there yourself, Aslan.\"\\n\\n\"I can give you no promise of that,\" answered the Lion. And he continued giving Peter his instructions.\\n\\nFor the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him. He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.\\n\\nIt was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water. But Peter said,\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t it be better to camp on the far side—for fear she should try a night attack or anything?\"\\n\\nAslan who seemed to have been thinking about something else roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said, \"Eh? What\\'s that?\" Peter said it all over again.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn\\'t matter. \"No. She will not make an attack to-night.\" And then he sighed deeply. But presently he added, \"All the same it was well thought of. That is how a soldier ought to think. But it doesn\\'t really matter.\" So they proceeded to pitch their camp.\\n\\nAslan\\'s mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing to their end.\\n\\nThis feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn\\'t get to sleep when she went to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you get to sleep either?\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Lucy. \"I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan?\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a most horrible feeling—as if something were hanging over us.\"\\n\\n\"Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.\"\\n\\n\"Something about Aslan,\" said Lucy. \"Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him, or something dreadful that he\\'s going to do.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s been something wrong with him all afternoon,\" said Susan. \"Lucy! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle? You don\\'t think he could be stealing away and leaving us to-night, do you?\"\\n\\n\"Where is he now?\" said Lucy. \"Is he here in the pavilion?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think so.\"\\n\\n\"Susan! Let\\'s go outside and have a look round. We might see him.\"\\n\\n\"All right. Let\\'s,\" said Susan, \"we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here.\"\\n\\nVery quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy\\'s arm and said, \"Look!\" On the far side of the camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followed him.\\n\\nHe led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the left—apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where there were no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It was no good trying to run away so they came towards him. When they were closer he said,\\n\\n\"Oh, children, children, why are you following me?\"\\n\\n\"We couldn\\'t sleep,\" said Lucy—and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.\\n\\n\"Please, may we come with you—wherever you\\'re going?\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Well—\" said Aslan and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, \"I should be glad of company to-night. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,\" said the two girls.\\n\\nForward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion. But how slowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan.\\n\\n\"Aslan! Dear Aslan!\" said Lucy, \"what is wrong? Can\\'t you tell us?\"\\n\\n\"Are you ill, dear Aslan?\" asked Susan.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Aslan. \"I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that.\"\\n\\nAnd so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his permission but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him—buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so doing, walked with him. And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got to the last tree (it was one that had some bushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,\\n\\n\"Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do not let yourselves be seen. Farewell.\"\\n\\nAnd both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him and this is what they saw.\\n\\nA great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned with evil-looking red flames and black smoke. But such people! Ogres with monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men; spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won\\'t describe because if I did the grown-ups would probably not let you read this book—Cruels and Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins. In fact here were all those who were on the Witch\\'s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command. And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.\\n\\nA howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they first saw the great Lion pacing towards them, and for a moment the Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and gave a wild, fierce laugh.\\n\\n\"The fool!\" she cried. \"The fool has come. Bind him fast.\"\\n\\nLucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan\\'s roar and his spring upon his enemies. But it never came. Four hags, grinning and leering, yet also (at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do, had approached him. \"Bind him, I say!\" repeated the White Witch. The hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all. Then others—evil dwarfs and apes—rushed in to help them and between them they rolled the huge Lion round on his back and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all. But he made no noise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut into his flesh. Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" said the Witch. \"Let him first be shaved.\"\\n\\nAnother roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan\\'s head. Snip-snip-snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground. Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane. The enemies also saw the difference.\\n\\n\"Why, he\\'s only a great cat after all!\" cried one.\\n\\n\"Is that what we were afraid of?\" said another.\\n\\nAnd they surged round Aslan jeering at him, saying things like \"Puss, Puss! Poor Pussy,\" and \"How many mice have you caught to-day, Cat?\" and \"Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?\"\\n\\n\"Oh how can they?\" said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"The brutes, the brutes!\" for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.\\n\\n\"Muzzle him!\" said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his face putting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands. But he never moved. And this seemed to enrage all that rabble. Everyone was at him now. Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him—so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him, jeering at him.\\n\\nAt last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him onto the surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening of cords.\\n\\n\"The cowards! The cowards!\" sobbed Susan. \"Are they still afraid of him, even now?\"\\n\\nWhen once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass of cords) on the flat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four torches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch bared her arms as she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan. Then she began to whet her knife. It looked to the children, when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone not of steel and it was of a strange and evil shape.\\n\\nAt last she drew near. She stood by Aslan\\'s head. Her face was working and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she stooped down and said in a quivering voice,\\n\\n\"And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well? And who will take him out of my hand then? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you have lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that knowledge, despair and die.\"\\n\\nThe children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn\\'t bear to look and had covered their eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nDeeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time\\n\\nWhile the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out.\\n\\n\"Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.\"\\n\\nAt this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill-top and down the slope right past their hiding-place. They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and overhead there went a flurry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other time they would have trembled with fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan\\'s death so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it.\\n\\nAs soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out into the open hill-top. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her, but still they could see the shape of the great Lion lying dead in his bonds. And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur—what was left of it—and cried till they could cry no more. And then they looked at each other and held each other\\'s hands for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy said,\\n\\n\"I can\\'t bear the look of that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take it off?\"\\n\\nSo they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold and it was now the darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could. And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe.\\n\\n\"I wonder could we untie him as well?\" said Susan presently. But the enemies, out of pure spitefulness had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of the knots.\\n\\nI hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night; but if you have been—if you\\'ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you—you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy noticed two other things. One was that the sky on the East side of the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago. The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her feet. At first she took no interest in this. What did it matter? Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw that whatever-it-was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And now whatever-they-were were moving about on Aslan\\'s body. She peered closer. They were little grey things.\\n\\n\"Ugh!\" said Susan from the other side of the Table. \"How beastly! There are horrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.\" And she raised her hand to frighten them away.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" said Lucy who had been looking at them more closely still. \"Can you see what they\\'re doing?\"\\n\\nBoth girls bent down and stared.\\n\\n\"I do believe!\" said Susan. \"But how queer. They\\'re nibbling away at the cords!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I thought,\" said Lucy. \"I think they\\'re friendly mice. Poor little things—they don\\'t realise he\\'s dead. They think it\\'ll do some good untying him.\"\\n\\nIt was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the first time the white face of the other. They could see the mice nibbling away; dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice. And at last, one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.\\n\\nThe sky in the East was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter—all except one very big one low down on the Eastern horizon. They felt colder than they had been all night. The mice crept away again.\\n\\nThe girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked more like himself without them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler, as the light grew and they could see it better.\\n\\nIn the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so still for hours and hours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it. Soon there were birds singing all over the place.\\n\\nIt was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so cold,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"So am I,\" said Susan. \"Let\\'s walk about a bit.\"\\n\\nThey walked to the Eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one big star had almost disappeared. The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea showed pale. The sky began to turn red. They walked to and fro more times than they could count between the dead Aslan and the Eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how tired their legs felt. Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel (which they could now just make out) the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun. At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise—a great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had broken a giant\\'s plate.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Lucy, clutching Susan\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"I—I feel afraid to turn round,\" said Susan; \"something awful is happening.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re doing something worse to him,\" said Lucy. \"Come on!\" And she turned, pulling Susan round with her.\\n\\nThe rising of the sun had made everything look so different—all the colours and shadows were changed—that for a moment they didn\\'t see the important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, oh!\" cried the two girls rushing back to the Table.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s too bad,\" sobbed Lucy; \"they might have left the body alone.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s done it?\" cried Susan. \"What does it mean? Is it more magic?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said a great voice behind their backs. \"It is more magic.\" They looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\n\\n\"Oh, Aslan!\" cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much frightened as they were glad.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you dead then, dear Aslan?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Not now,\" said Aslan.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not—not a—?\" asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn\\'t bring herself to say the word ghost.\\n\\nAslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead. The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.\\n\\n\"Do I look it?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re real, you\\'re real! Oh, Aslan!\" cried Lucy and both girls flung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses.\\n\\n\"But what does it all mean?\" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.\\n\\n\"It means,\" said Aslan, \"that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor\\'s stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards. And now—\\n\\n\"Oh yes. Now?\" said Lucy jumping up and clapping her hands.\\n\\n\"Oh, children,\" said the Lion, \"I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh, children, catch me if you can!\" He stood for a second, his eyes very bright, his limbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail. Then he made a leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table. Laughing, though she didn\\'t know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach him. Aslan leaped again. A mad chase began. Round and round the hill-top he led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost catch his tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such a romp as no one has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind. And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Aslan presently, \"to business. I feel I am going to roar. You had better put your fingers in your ears.\"\\n\\nAnd they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind. Then he said,\\n\\n\"We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.\" And he crouched down and the children climbed onto his warm, golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan. And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off, faster than any horse could go, downhill and into the thick of the forest.\\n\\nThat ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the harness and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this is a mount that doesn\\'t need to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree-trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs but right across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers.\\n\\nIt was nearly mid-day when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle—a little toy castle it looked from where they stood—which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it. And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them. No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And Aslan, not at all slacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.\\n\\n\"The Witch\\'s home!\" he cried. \"Now, children, hold tight.\"\\n\\nNext moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the children felt as if they had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped—or you may call it flying rather than jumping—right over the castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nWhat Happened about the Statues\\n\\n\"What an extraordinary place!\" cried Lucy. \"All those stone animals—and people too! It\\'s—it\\'s like a museum.\"\\n\\n\"Hush,\" said Susan, \"Aslan\\'s doing something.\"\\n\\nHe was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him. Then without waiting a moment he whisked round—almost as if he had been a cat chasing its tail—and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which (as you remember) was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it. Then he pounced on a tall stone Dryad which stood beyond the dwarf, turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to two centaurs. But at that moment Lucy said,\\n\\n\"Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.\"\\n\\nI expect you\\'ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same. Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back—then it spread—then the colour seemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all over a bit of paper—then, while his hind-quarters were still obviously stone the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stony folds rippled into living hair. Then he opened a great red mouth, warm and living, and gave a prodigious yawn. And now his hind legs had come to life. He lifted one of them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face.\\n\\nOf course the children\\'s eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the statues were coming to life. The courtyard looked no longer like a museum; it looked more like a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard was now a blaze of colours; glossy chestnut sides of centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy-brown of foxes, dogs, and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs; and the birch-girls in silver, and the beech-girls in fresh, transparent green, and the larch-girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow. And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings, brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings, shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.\\n\\n\"Ooh!\" said Susan in a different tone. \"Look! I wonder—I mean, is it safe?\"\\n\\nLucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right!\" shouted Aslan joyously. \"Once the feet are put right, all the rest of him will follow.\"\\n\\n\"That wasn\\'t exactly what I meant,\" whispered Susan to Lucy. But it was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her. The change was already creeping up the Giant\\'s legs. Now he was moving his feet. A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder, rubbed his eyes and said,\\n\\n\"Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where\\'s that dratted little Witch that was running about on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it was.\" But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened, and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood, then he bowed down till his head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his honest ugly face, (giants of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming. It\\'s a sight well worth looking at.)\\n\\n\"Now for the inside of this house!\" said Aslan. \"Look alive, everyone. Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady\\'s chamber! Leave no corner unsearched. You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.\"\\n\\nAnd into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of that dark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows and with everyone\\'s voices crying out at once \"Don\\'t forget the dungeons—Give us a hand with this door!—Here\\'s another little winding stair—Oh! I say. Here\\'s a poor little kangaroo. Call Aslan—Phew! How it smells in here—Look out for trap-doors—Up here! There are a whole lot more on the landing!\" But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out,\\n\\n\"Aslan! Aslan! I\\'ve found Mr. Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.\"\\n\\nA moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding one another by both hands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all she had to tell him.\\n\\nBut at last the ransacking of the Witch\\'s fortress was ended. The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil places which needed them so badly. The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the courtyard. And it was then that someone (Tumnus, I think) first said,\\n\\n\"But how are we going to get out?\" for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gates were still locked.\\n\\n\"That\\'ll be all right,\" said Aslan; and then, rising on his hind-legs, he bawled up at the Giant. \"Hi! You up there,\" he roared. \"What\\'s your name?\"\\n\\n\"Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour,\" said the Giant, once more touching his cap.\\n\\n\"Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,\" said Aslan, \"just let us out of this, will you?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, your honour. It will be a pleasure,\" said Giant Rumblebuffin. \"Stand well away from the gates, all you little \\'uns.\" Then he strode to the gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club. The gates creaked at the first blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third. Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble; and when the dust cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky.\\n\\n\"Blowed if I ain\\'t all in a muck sweat,\" said the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine. \"Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket-handkerchee about you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Lucy standing on tip-toes and holding her handkerchief up as far as she could reach.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Missie,\" said Giant Rumblebuffin stooping down. Next moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid-air between the Giant\\'s finger and thumb. But just as she was getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering, \"Bless me! I\\'ve picked up the little girl instead. I beg your pardon, Missie, I thought you was the handkerchee!\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said Lucy laughing, \"here it is!\" This time he managed to get it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you, so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face, she said, \"I\\'m afraid it\\'s not much use to you, Mr. Rumblebuffin.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. Not at all,\" said the Giant politely. \"Never met a nicer handkerchee. So fine, so handy. So—I don\\'t know how to describe it.\"\\n\\n\"What a nice giant he is!\" said Lucy to Mr. Tumnus.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" replied the Faun. \"All the Buffins always were. One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps (I never knew a giant that was) but an old family. With traditions, you know. If he\\'d been the other sort she\\'d never have turned him into stone.\"\\n\\nAt this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.\\n\\n\"Our day\\'s work is not yet over,\" he said, \"and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed-time we must find the battle at once.\"\\n\\n\"And join in I hope, Sir!\" added the largest of the centaurs.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Aslan. \"And now! Those who can\\'t keep up—that is, children, dwarfs, and small animals—must ride on the backs of those who can—that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out where the battle is. Look lively and sort yourselves.\"\\n\\nAnd with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased of the lot was the other lion, who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met, \"Did you hear what he said? Us lions. That means him and me. Us lions. That\\'s what I like about Aslan. No side, no stand-off-ishness. Us lions. That meant him and me.\" At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, one Dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a bit.\\n\\nWhen all were ready (it was a big sheep-dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order) they set out through the gap in the castle wall. At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all directions. But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay. There was no time lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half a mile behind them, were following as fast as they could. The noise was like an English fox-hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster and faster they went as the scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just as they came to the last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises another noise—a different one, which gave her a queer feeling inside. It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.\\n\\nThen they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan\\'s army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed. There also seemed to be far more of them. Aslan\\'s army—which had their backs to her—looked terribly few. And there were statues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch had been using her wand. But she did not seem to be using it now. She was fighting with her stone knife. It was Peter she was fighting—both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening; she only saw the stone knife and Peter\\'s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knives and three swords. That pair were in the centre. On each side the line stretched out. Horrible things were happening wherever she looked.\\n\\n\"Off my back, children,\" shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off. Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the Western lamp-post to the shores of the Eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch. Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath; and at the same moment all war-like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch\\'s house rushed madly on the enemy\\'s line, dwarfs with their battle-axes, dogs with teeth, the giant with his club (and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe) unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs. And Peter\\'s tired army cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nThe Hunting of the White Stag\\n\\nThe battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his companions; and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. The next thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange to her to see Peter looking as he looked now—his face was so pale and stern and he seemed so much older.\\n\\n\"It was all Edmund\\'s doing, Aslan,\" Peter was saying. \"We\\'d have been beaten if it hadn\\'t been for him. The Witch was-turning our troops into stone right and left. But nothing would stop him. He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue. And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were making. Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance—if we hadn\\'t lost so many already. He was terribly wounded. We must go and see him.\"\\n\\nThey found Edmund in charge of Mrs. Beaver a little way back from the fighting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face a nasty green colour.\\n\\n\"Quick, Lucy,\" said Aslan.\\n\\nAnd then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her brother\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\"There are other people wounded,\" said Aslan while she was still looking eagerly into Edmund\\'s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result.\\n\\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Lucy crossly. \"Wait a minute.\"\\n\\n\"Daughter of Eve,\" said Aslan in a graver voice, \"others also are at the point of death. Must more people die for Edmund?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Aslan,\" said Lucy getting up and going with him. And for the next half hour they were busy—she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone. When at last she was free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look—oh, for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a Knight.\\n\\n\"Does he know,\" whispered Lucy to Susan, \"what Aslan did for him? Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! No. Of course not,\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"Oughtn\\'t he to be told?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Oh, surely not,\" said Susan. \"It would be too awful for him. Think how you\\'d feel if you were he.\"\\n\\n\"All the same I think he ought to know,\" said Lucy. But at that moment they were interrupted.\\n\\nThat night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them all I don\\'t know; but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o\\'clock. Next day they began marching Eastward down the side of the great river. And the next day after that, at about tea-time, they actually reached the mouth. The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before them were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and sea weed, and the smell of the sea, and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking forever and ever on the beach. And, oh, the cry of the sea gulls! Have you heard it? Can you remember?\\n\\nThat evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes. But next day was more solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel—that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west door all hung with peacock\\'s feathers and the eastern door which opens right onto the sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them onto the four thrones amid deafening shouts of, \"Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live King Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!\"\\n\\n\"Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!\" said Aslan.\\n\\nAnd through the Eastern door, which was wide open came the voices of the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the castle steps and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens.\\n\\nSo the children sat in their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands and they gave rewards and honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.\\n\\nBut amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn\\'t there they said nothing about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them, \"He\\'ll be coming and going\" he had said. \"One day you\\'ll see him and another you won\\'t. He doesn\\'t like being tied down—and of course he has other countries to attend to. It\\'s quite all right. He\\'ll often drop in. Only you mustn\\'t press him. He\\'s wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\"\\n\\nAnd now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well and long and happy was their reign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch\\'s army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest—a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin) on the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them. And Peter became a tall and deep chested man and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the Kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage. And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgement. He was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden haired, and all Princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.\\n\\nSo they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus (who was a middle-aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout) came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his parts—the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him. So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him. And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses of all the courtiers were tired out and only these four were still following. And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King Peter (for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and Queens for so long) \"Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said the others, \"even so let us do.\"\\n\\nSo they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,\\n\\n\"Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said King Edmund, \"if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.\"\\n\\n\"Marry, a strange device,\" said King Peter, \"to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man!\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Queen Lucy. \"By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a young wood and the iron post is old.\" And they stood looking upon it. Then said King Edmund,\\n\\n\"I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely. It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a dream, or in the dream of a dream.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered they all, \"it is even so with us also.\"\\n\\n\"And more,\" said Queen Lucy, \"for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern, either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said King Edmund, \"the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also.\"\\n\\n\"And in mine, fair brother,\" said King Peter.\\n\\n\"And in mine too,\" said Queen Susan. \"Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said King Peter, \"therein I pray thee to have me excused. For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice, and the like, and then given over; but always what we have taken in hand, the same we have achieved.\"\\n\\n\"Sister,\" said Queen Lucy, \"my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase.\"\\n\\n\"And so say I,\" said King Edmund. \"And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.\"\\n\\n\"Then in the name of Aslan,\" said Queen Susan, \"if ye will all have it so, let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.\"\\n\\nSo these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamp-post, and before they had gone twenty more, they noticed that they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide. Mrs. Macready and the visitors were still talking in the passage; but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the children weren\\'t caught.\\n\\nAnd that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn\\'t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man, didn\\'t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story. \"No,\" he said, \"I don\\'t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won\\'t get into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did! Eh? What\\'s that? Yes, of course you\\'ll get back to Narnia again some day. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don\\'t go trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don\\'t try to get there at all. It\\'ll happen when you\\'re not looking for it. And don\\'t talk too much about it even among yourselves. And don\\'t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they\\'ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What\\'s that? How will you know? Oh, you\\'ll know all right. Odd things, they say—even their looks—will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools?\"\\n\\nAnd that is the very end of the adventures of the wardrobe. But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe End\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'CHAPTER I  Lucy Looks into a Wardrobe  Once there were four children whose names were Peter  Susan  Edmund and Lucy  This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air raids  They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country  ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office  He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs  Macready and three servants   Their names were Ivy  Margaret and Betty  but they do not come into the story much   He himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair  which grew over most of his face as well as on his head  and they liked him almost at once  but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he was so odd looking that Lucy  who was the youngest  was a little afraid of him  and Edmund  who was the next youngest  wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it   As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night  the boys came into the girls  room and they all talked it over    We ve fallen on our feet and no mistake   said Peter   This is going to be perfectly splendid  That old chap will let us do anything we like     I think he s an old dear   said Susan    Oh  come off it   said Edmund  who was tired and pretending not to be tired  which always made him bad tempered   Don t go on talking like that     Like what   said Susan   and anyway  it s time you were in bed     Trying to talk like Mother   said Edmund   And who are you to say when I m to go to bed  Go to bed yourself     Hadn t we all better go to bed   said Lucy   There s sure to be a row if we re heard talking here     No there won t   said Peter   I tell you this is the sort of house where no one s going to mind what we do  Anyway  they won t hear us  It s about ten minutes  walk from here down to that dining room  and any amount of stairs and passages in between     What s that noise   said Lucy suddenly  It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy    It s only a bird  silly   said Edmund    It s an owl   said Peter   This is going to be a wonderful place for birds  I shall go to bed now  I say  let s go and explore to morrow  You might find anything in a place like this  Did you see those mountains as we came along  And the woods  There might be eagles  There might be stags  There ll be hawks     Badgers   said Lucy    Snakes   said Edmund    Foxes   said Susan   But when next morning came  there was a steady rain falling  so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden    Of course it would be raining   said Edmund  They had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them a long  low room with two windows looking out in one direction and two in another    Do stop grumbling  Ed   said Susan   Ten to one it ll clear up in an hour or so  And in the meantime we re pretty well off  There s a wireless and lots of books     Not for me   said Peter   I m going to explore in the house    Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began  It was the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of  and it was full of unexpected places  The first few doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms  as everyone had expected that they would  but soon they came to a very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour  and after that was a room all hung with green  with a harp in one corner  and then came three steps down and five steps up  and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony  and then a whole series of rooms that led into each other and were lined with books most of them very old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church  And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty except for one big wardrobe  the sort that has a looking glass in the door  There was nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue bottle on the window sill    Nothing there   said Peter  and they all trooped out again all except Lucy  She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe  even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked  To her surprise it opened quite easily  and two moth balls dropped out   Looking into the inside  she saw several coats hanging up mostly long fur coats  There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur  She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them  leaving the door open  of course  because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe  Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one  It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe  She took a step further in then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork against the tips of her fingers  But she could not feel it    This must be a simply enormous wardrobe   thought Lucy  going still further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her  Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet   I wonder is that more moth balls   she thought  stooping down to feel it with her hands  But instead of feeling the hard  smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe  she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold   This is very queer   she said  and went on a step or two further   Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly   Why  it is just like branches of trees   exclaimed Lucy  And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her  not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been  but a long way off  Something cold and soft was falling on her  A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air   Lucy felt a little frightened  but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well  She looked back over her shoulder and there  between the dark tree trunks  she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out   She had  of course  left the door open  for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe   It seemed to be still daylight there   I can always get back if anything goes wrong   thought Lucy  She began to walk forward  crunch crunch  over the snow and through the wood towards the other light   In about ten minutes she reached it and found that it was a lamp post  As she stood looking at it  wondering why there was a lamp post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next  she heard a pitter patter of feet coming towards her  And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp post   He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella  white with snow  From the waist upwards he was like a man  but his legs were shaped like a goat s  the hair on them was glossy black  and instead of feet he had goat s hoofs  He also had a tail  but Lucy did not notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow  He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too  He had a strange  but pleasant little face with a short pointed beard and curly hair  and out of the hair there stuck two horns  one on each side of his forehead  One of his hands  as I have said  held the umbrella  in the other arm he carried several brown paper parcels  What with the parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping  He was a Faun  And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcels    Goodness gracious me   exclaimed the Faun       CHAPTER II  What Lucy Found There   Good evening   said Lucy  But the Faun was so busy picking up his parcels that at first he did not reply  When he had finished he made her a little bow    Good evening  good evening   said the Faun   Excuse me I don t want to be inquisitive but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve     My name s Lucy   said she  not quite understanding him    But you are forgive me you are what they call a girl   asked the Faun    Of course I m a girl   said Lucy    You are in fact Human     Of course I m human   said Lucy  still a little puzzled    To be sure  to be sure   said the Faun   How stupid of me  But I ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before  I am delighted  That is to say   and then he stopped as if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time   Delighted  delighted   he went on   Allow me to introduce myself  My name is Tumnus     I am very pleased to meet you  Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy    And may I ask  O Lucy  Daughter of Eve   said Mr  Tumnus   how you have come into Narnia     Narnia  What s that   said Lucy    This is the land of Narnia   said the Faun   where we are now  all that lies between the lamp post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea  And you you have come from the wild woods of the west     I I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room   said Lucy    Ah   said Mr  Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice   if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun  I should no doubt know all about those strange countries  It is too late now     But they aren t countries at all   said Lucy  almost laughing   It s only just back there at least I m not sure  It is summer there     Meanwhile   said Mr  Tumnus   it is winter in Narnia  and has been for ever so long  and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow  Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe  how would it be if you came and had tea with me     Thank you very much  Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy   But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back     It s only just round the corner   said the Faun   and there ll be a roaring fire and toast and sardines and cake     Well  it s very kind of you   said Lucy   But I shan t be able to stay long     If you will take my arm  Daughter of Eve   said Mr  Tumnus   I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us  That s the way  Now off we go    And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives   They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down  At the bottom of one small valley Mr  Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock  but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave  As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire  Then Mr  Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs  and lit a lamp   Now we shan t be long   he said  and immediately put a kettle on   Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place  It was a little  dry  clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs   one for me and one for a friend   said Mr  Tumnus  and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard  In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr  Tumnus  bedroom  and on one wall was a shelf full of books  Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things  They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men  Monks and Gamekeepers  a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth    Now  Daughter of Eve   said the Faun   And really it was a wonderful tea  There was a nice brown egg  lightly boiled  for each of them  and then sardines on toast  and then buttered toast  and then toast with honey  and then a sugar topped cake  And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk  He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest  He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns  about long hunting parties after the milk white Stag who could give you wishes if you caught him  about feasting and treasure seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor  and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them  and sometimes Bacchus himself  and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end   Not that it isn t always winter now   he added gloomily  Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play  And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time  It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said    Oh Mr  Tumnus I m so sorry to stop you  and I do love that tune but really  I must go home  I only meant to stay for a few minutes     It s no good now  you know   said the Faun  laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully    No good   said Lucy  jumping up and feeling rather frightened   What do you mean  I ve got to go home at once  The others will be wondering what has happened to me   But a moment later she asked   Mr  Tumnus  Whatever is the matter   for the Faun s brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down his cheeks  and soon they were running off the end of his nose  and at last he covered his face with his hands and began to howl    Mr  Tumnus  Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy in great distress   Don t  Don t  What is the matter  Aren t you well  Dear Mr  Tumnus  do tell me what is wrong   But the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break  And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her handkerchief  he did not stop  He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it  wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use  so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch    Mr  Tumnus   bawled Lucy in his ear  shaking him   Do stop  Stop it at once  You ought to be ashamed of yourself  a great big Faun like you  What on earth are you crying about     Oh oh oh   sobbed Mr  Tumnus   I m crying because I m such a bad Faun     I don t think you re a bad Faun at all   said Lucy   I think you are a very good Faun  You are the nicest Faun I ve ever met     Oh oh you wouldn t say that if you knew   replied Mr  Tumnus between his sobs   No  I m a bad Faun  I don t suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world     But what have you done   asked Lucy    My old father  now   said Mr  Tumnus   that s his picture over the mantelpiece  He would never have done a thing like this     A thing like what   said Lucy    Like what I ve done   said the Faun   Taken service under the White Witch  That s what I am  I m in the pay of the White Witch     The White Witch  Who is she     Why  it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb  It s she that makes it always winter  Always winter and never Christmas  think of that     How awful   said Lucy   But what does she pay you for     That s the worst of it   said Mr  Tumnus with a deep groan   I m a kidnapper for her  that s what I am  Look at me  Daughter of Eve  Would you believe that I m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood  one that had never done me any harm  and pretend to be friendly with it  and invite it home to my cave  all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch     No   said Lucy   I m sure you wouldn t do anything of the sort     But I have   said the Faun    Well   said Lucy rather slowly  for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him    well  that was pretty bad  But you re so sorry for it that I m sure you will never do it again     Daughter of Eve  don t you understand   said the Faun   It isn t something I have done  I m doing it now  this very moment     What do you mean   cried Lucy  turning very white    You are the child   said Mr  Tumnus   I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood  I was to catch them and hand them over to her  And you are the first I ever met  And I ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea  and all the time I ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell her     Oh but you won t  Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy   You won t  will you  Indeed  indeed you really mustn t     And if I don t   said he  beginning to cry again   she s sure to find out  And she ll have my tail cut off  and my horns sawn off  and my beard plucked out  and she ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse s  And if she is extra and specially angry she ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness knows when that will happen  or whether it will ever happen at all     I m very sorry  Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy   But please let me go home     Of course I will   said the Faun   Of course I ve got to  I see that now  I hadn t known what Humans were like before I met you  Of course I can t give you up to the Witch  not now that I know you  But we must be off at once  I ll see you back to the lamp post  I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe     I m sure I can   said Lucy    We must go as quietly as we can   said Mr  Tumnus   The whole wood is full of her spies  Even some of the trees are on her side    They both got up and left the tea things on the table  and Mr  Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm  and they went out into the snow  The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun s cave  they stole along as quickly as they could  without speaking a word  and Mr  Tumnus kept to the darkest places  Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp post again    Do you know your way from here  Daughter of Eve   said Tumnus   Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight   Yes   she said   I can see the wardrobe door     Then be off home as quick as you can   said the Faun   and c can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do     Why  of course I can   said Lucy  shaking him heartily by the hand   And I do hope you won t get into dreadful trouble on my account     Farewell  Daughter of Eve   said he   Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief     Rather   said Lucy  and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her  And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her she felt coats  and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden boards  and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started  She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around  panting for breath  It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage    I m here   she shouted   I m here  I ve come back  I m all right        CHAPTER III  Edmund and the Wardrobe  Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three    It s all right   she repeated   I ve come back     What on earth are you talking about  Lucy   asked Susan    Why   said Lucy in amazement   haven t you all been wondering where I was     So you ve been hiding  have you   said Peter   Poor old Lu  hiding and nobody noticed  You ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you     But I ve been away for hours and hours   said Lucy   The others all stared at one another    Batty   said Edmund tapping his head   Quite batty     What do you mean  Lu   asked Peter    What I said   answered Lucy   It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe  and I ve been away for hours and hours  and had tea  and all sorts of things have happened     Don t be silly  Lucy   said Susan   We ve only just come out of that room a moment ago  and you were there then     She s not being silly at all   said Peter   she s just making up a story for fun  aren t you  Lu  And why shouldn t she     No  Peter  I m not   she said   It s it s a magic wardrobe  There s a wood inside it  and it s snowing  and there s a Faun and a witch and it s called Narnia  come and see    The others did not know what to think  but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her into the room  She rushed ahead of them  flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried   Now  go in and see for yourselves     Why  you goose   said Susan  putting her head inside and pulling the fur coats apart   it s just an ordinary wardrobe  look  there s the back of it    Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart  and they all saw Lucy herself saw a perfectly ordinary wardrobe  There was no wood and no snow  only the back of the wardrobe  with hooks on it  Peter went in and rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid    A jolly good hoax  Lu   he said as he came out again   you have really taken us in  I must admit  We half believed you     But it wasn t a hoax at all   said Lucy   really and truly  It was all different a moment ago  Honestly it was  I promise     Come  Lu   said Peter   that s going a bit far  You ve had your joke  Hadn t you better drop it now    Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something  though she hardly knew what she was trying to say  and burst into tears   For the next few days she was very miserable  She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun  But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right  and she could not bring herself to say this  The others who thought she was telling a lie  and a silly lie too  made her very unhappy  The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it  but Edmund could be spiteful  and on this occasion he was spiteful  He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she d found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house  What made it worse was that these days ought to have been delightful  The weather was fine and they were out of doors from morning to night  bathing  fishing  climbing trees  birds  nesting  and lying in the heather  But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it  And so things went on until the next wet day   That day  when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather  they decided to play hide and seek  Susan was  It  and as soon as the others scattered to hide  Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe was  She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe  because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business  But she did want to have one more look inside it  for by this time she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream  The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding places that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else  But as soon as she reached it she heard steps in the passage outside  and then there was nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her  She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe  even if it is not a magic one   Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund  and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe  He at once decided to get into it himself not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country  He opened the door  There were the coats hanging up as usual  and a smell of mothballs  and darkness and silence  and no sign of Lucy   She thinks I m Susan come to catch her   said Edmund to himself   and so she s keeping very quiet in at the back   He jumped in and shut the door  forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do  Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark  He had expected to find her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not  He decided to open the door again and let in some light  But he could not find the door either  He didn t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction  he even shouted out   Lucy  Lu  Where are you  I know you re here    There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound not the sound you expect in a cupboard but a kind of open air sound  He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold  and then he saw a light    Thank goodness   said Edmund   the door must have swung open of its own accord   He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe  But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood   There was crisp  dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees  Overhead there was a pale blue sky  the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning  Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree trunks the sun  just rising  very red and clear  Everything was perfectly still  as if he were the only living creature in that country  There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees  and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every direction  He shivered   He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy  and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her  imaginary country  which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all  He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted   Lucy  Lucy  I m here too Edmund    There was no answer    She s angry about all the things I ve been saying lately   thought Edmund  And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong  he also did not much like being alone in this strange  cold  quiet place  so he shouted again    I say  Lu  I m sorry I didn t believe you  I see now you were right all along  Do come out  Make it Pax    Still there was no answer    Just like a girl   said Edmund to himself   sulking somewhere  and won t accept an apology   He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place  and had almost made up his mind to go home  when he heard  very far off in the wood  a sound of bells  He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer   The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them  their branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them  Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells  On the sledge  driving the reindeer  sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high if he had been standing  He was dressed in polar bear s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point  his huge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug  But behind him  on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person a great lady  taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen  She also was covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head  Her face was white not merely pale  but white like snow or paper or icing sugar  except for her very red mouth  It was a beautiful face in other respects  but proud and cold and stern   The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the Dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it    Stop   said the Lady  and the Dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down  Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing  In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke    And what  pray  are you   said the Lady  looking hard at Edmund    I m I m my name s Edmund   said Edmund rather awkwardly  He did not like the way she looked at him   The Lady frowned   Is that how you address a Queen   she asked  looking sterner than ever    I beg your pardon  your Majesty  I didn t know   said Edmund    Not know the Queen of Narnia   cried she   Ha  You shall know us better hereafter  But I repeat what are you     Please  your Majesty   said Edmund   I don t know what you mean  I m at school at least I was it s the holidays now        CHAPTER IV  Turkish Delight   But what are you   said the Queen again   Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard     No  your Majesty   said Edmund   I never had a beard  I m a boy     A boy   said she   Do you mean you are a Son of Adam    Edmund stood still  saying nothing  He was too confused by this time to understand what the question meant    I see you are an idiot  whatever else you may be   said the Queen   Answer me  once and for all  or I shall lose my patience  Are you human     Yes  your Majesty   said Edmund    And how  pray  did you come to enter my dominions     Please  your Majesty  I came in through a wardrobe     A wardrobe  What do you mean     I I opened a door and just found myself here  your Majesty   said Edmund    Ha   said the Queen  speaking more to herself than to him   A door  A door from the world of men  I have heard of such things  This may wreck all  But he is only one  and he is easily dealt with   As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face  her eyes flaming  at the same moment she raised her wand  Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move  Then  just as he gave himself up for lost  she appeared to change her mind    My poor child   she said in quite a different voice   how cold you look  Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk    Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey  he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet  and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in    Perhaps something hot to drink   said the Queen   Should you like that     Yes please  your Majesty   said Edmund  whose teeth were chattering   The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it were made of copper  Then  holding out her arm  she let one drop fall from it on to the snow beside the sledge  Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid air  shining like a diamond  But the moment it touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed  The Dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile  not a very nice smile  Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink  It was something he had never tasted before  very sweet and foamy and creamy  and it warmed him right down to his toes    It is dull  Son of Adam  to drink without eating   said the Queen presently   What would you like best to eat     Turkish Delight  please  your Majesty   said Edmund   The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow  and instantly there appeared a round box  tied with green silk ribbon  which  when opened  turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight  Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious  He was quite warm now  and very comfortable   While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions  At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one s mouth full  but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could  and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat  and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive  She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters  and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there  and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia  She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them  and kept on coming back to it   You are sure there are just four of you   she asked   Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve  neither more nor less   and Edmund  with his mouth full of Turkish Delight  kept on saying   Yes  I told you that before   and forgetting to call her  Your Majesty  but she didn t seem to mind now   At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more  Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking  for she knew  though Edmund did not  that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it  and would even  if they were allowed  go on eating it till they killed themselves  But she did not offer him any more  Instead  she said to him    Son of Adam  I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters  Will you bring them to see me     I ll try   said Edmund  still looking at the empty box    Because  if you did come again bringing them with you of course I d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight  I can t do it now  the magic will only work once  In my own house it would be another matter     Why can t we go to your house now   said Edmund  When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back  but he had forgotten about that fear now    It is a lovely place  my house   said the Queen   I am sure you would like it  There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight  and what s more  I have no children of my own  I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone  While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long  and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I ve ever met  I think I would like to make you the Prince some day  when you bring the others to visit me     Why not now   said Edmund  His face had become very red and his mouth and fingers were sticky  He did not look either clever or handsome whatever the Queen might say    Oh  but if I took you there now   said she   I shouldn t see your brother and your sisters  I very much want to know your charming relations  You are to be the Prince and later on the King  that is understood  But you must have courtiers and nobles  I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses     There s nothing special about them   said Edmund   and  anyway  I could always bring them some other time     Ah  but once you were in my house   said the Queen   you might forget all about them  You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn t want the bother of going to fetch them  No  You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day  with them  you understand  It is no good coming without them     But I don t even know the way back to my own country   pleaded Edmund    That s easy   answered the Queen   Do you see that lamp   She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp post under which Lucy had met the Faun   Straight on  beyond that  is the way to the World of Men  And now look the other way  here she pointed in the opposite direction  and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees     I think I can   said Edmund    Well my house is between those two hills  So next time you come you have only to find the lamp post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house  You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it  But remember you must bring the others with you  I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone     I ll do my best   said Edmund    And  by the way   said the Queen   you needn t tell them about me  It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two  wouldn t it  Make it a surprise for them  Just bring them along to the two hills a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that and when you come to my house you could just say  Let s see who lives here  or something like that  I am sure that would be best  If your sister has met one of the Fauns  she may have heard strange stories about me nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me  Fauns will say anything  you know  and now     Please  please   said Edmund suddenly   please couldn t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home     No  no   said the Queen with a laugh   you must wait till next time   While she spoke  she signalled to the Dwarf to drive on  but as the sledge swept away out of sight  the Queen waved to Edmund calling out   Next time  Next time  Don t forget  Come soon    Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name  and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood    Oh  Edmund   she cried   So you ve got in too  Isn t it wonderful  and now     All right   said Edmund   I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all  I ll say I m sorry if you like  But where on earth have you been all this time  I ve been looking for you everywhere     If I d known you had got in I d have waited for you   said Lucy who was too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face was   I ve been having lunch with dear Mr  Tumnus  the Faun  and he s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go  so he thinks she can t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all     The White Witch   said Edmund   who s she     She is a perfectly terrible person   said Lucy   She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all  and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarfs and animals at least all the good ones simply hate her  And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things  And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia always winter  but it never gets to Christmas  And she drives about on a sledge  drawn by a reindeer  with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head    Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets  and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable  But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else    Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch   he asked    Mr  Tumnus  the Faun   said Lucy    You can t always believe what Fauns say   said Edmund  trying to sound as if he knew far more about them than Lucy    Who said so   asked Lucy    Everyone knows it   said Edmund   ask anybody you like  But it s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow  Let s go home     Yes  let s   said Lucy   Oh Edmund  I am glad you ve got in too  The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there  What fun it will be    But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her  He would have to admit that Lucy had been right  before all the others  and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals  but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch  He did not know what he would say  or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia   By this time they had walked a good way  Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room    I say   said Lucy   you do look awful  Edmund  Don t you feel well     I m all right   said Edmund  but this was not true  He was feeling very sick    Come on then   said Lucy   let s find the others  What a lot we shall have to tell them  And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we re all in it together        CHAPTER V  Back on This Side of the Door  Because the game of hide and seek was still going on  it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others  But when at last they were all together  which happened in the long room  where the suit of armour was  Lucy burst out    Peter  Susan  It s all true  Edmund has seen it too  There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe  Edmund and I both got in  We met one another in there  in the wood  Go on  Edmund  tell them all about it     What s all this about  Ed   said Peter   And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story  Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick  and sulky  and annoyed with Lucy for being right  but he hadn t made up his mind what to do  When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of  He decided to let Lucy down    Tell us  Ed   said Susan   And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy  there was really only a year s difference  and then a little snigger and said   Oh  yes  Lucy and I have been playing pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true  Just for fun  of course  There s nothing there really    Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room   Edmund  who was becoming a nastier person every minute  thought that he had scored a great success  and went on at once to say   There she goes again  What s the matter with her  That s the worst of young kids  they always     Look here   said Peter turning on him savagely   shut up  You ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again  I believe you did it simply out of spite     But it s all nonsense   said Edmund  very taken aback    Of course it s all nonsense   said Peter   that s just the point  Lu was perfectly all right when we left home  but since we ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar  But whichever it is  what good do you think you ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next     I thought I thought   said Edmund  but he couldn t think of anything to say    You didn t think anything at all   said Peter   it s just spite  You ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself  we ve seen that at school before now     Do stop it   said Susan   it won t make things any better having a row between you two  Let s go and find Lucy    It was not surprising that when they found Lucy  a good deal later  everyone could see that she had been crying  Nothing they could say to her made any difference  She stuck to her story and said    I don t care what you think  and I don t care what you say  You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like  I know I ve met a Faun in there and I wish I d stayed there and you are all beasts  beasts    It was an unpleasant evening  Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his plan wasn t working as well as he had expected  The two older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind  They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had gone to bed   The result was that next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor   He ll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu   said Peter   it s getting beyond us   So they went and knocked at the study door  and the Professor said  Come in   and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal  Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and never interrupting  till they had finished the whole story  After that he said nothing for quite a long time  Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected    How do you know   he asked   that your sister s story is not true     Oh  but   began Susan  and then stopped  Anyone could see from the old man s face that he was perfectly serious  Then Susan pulled herself together and said   But Edmund said they had only been pretending     That is a point   said the Professor   which certainly deserves consideration  very careful consideration  For instance if you will excuse me for asking the question does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable  I mean  which is the more truthful     That s just the funny thing about it  Sir   said Peter   Up till now  I d have said Lucy every time     And what do you think  my dear   said the Professor  turning to Susan    Well   said Susan   in general  I d say the same as Peter  but this couldn t be true all this about the wood and the Faun     That is more than I know   said the Professor   and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing  a very serious thing indeed     We were afraid it mightn t even be lying   said Susan   We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy     Madness  you mean   said the Professor quite coolly   Oh  you can make your minds easy about that  One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad     But then   said Susan and stopped  She had never dreamed that a grown up would talk like the Professor and didn t know what to think    Logic   said the Professor half to himself   Why don t they teach logic at these schools  There are only three possibilities  Either your sister is telling lies  or she is mad  or she is telling the truth  You know she doesn t tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad  For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up  we must assume that she is telling the truth    Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was not making fun of them    But how could it be true  Sir   said Peter    Why do you say that   asked the Professor    Well  for one thing   said Peter   if it was real why doesn t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe  I mean  there was nothing there when we looked  even Lucy didn t pretend there was     What has that to do with it   said the Professor    Well  Sir  if things are real  they re there all the time     Are they   said the Professor  and Peter did not know quite what to say    But there was no time   said Susan   Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere  even if there was such a place  She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room  It was less than a minute  and she pretended to have been away for hours     That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true   said the Professor   If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world  and I should warn you that this is a very strange house  and even I know very little about it  if  I say  she had got into another world  I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of its own  so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time  On the other hand  I don t think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves  If she had been pretending  she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story     But do you really mean  Sir   said Peter   that there could be other worlds all over the place  just round the corner like that     Nothing is more probable   said the Professor  taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them  while he muttered to himself   I wonder what they do teach them at these schools     But what are we to do   said Susan  She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point    My dear young lady   said the Professor  suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them   there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying     What s that   said Susan    We might all try minding our own business   said he  And that was the end of that conversation   After this things were a good deal better for Lucy  Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her  and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all  It had become a rather alarming subject  And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end  but that was not to be   This house of the Professor s which even he knew so little about was so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it  It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories  and well it might be  for all manner of stories were told about it  some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now  And when parties of sight seers arrived and asked to see the house  the Professor always gave them permission  and Mrs  Macready  the housekeeper  showed them round  telling them about the pictures and the armour  and the rare books in the library  Mrs  Macready was not fond of children  and did not like to be interrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew  She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first morning  along with a good many other instructions   And please remember you re to keep out of the way whenever I m taking a party over the house     Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown ups   said Edmund  and the other three thought the same  That was how the adventures began for the second time   A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said   Look out  Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her     Sharp s the word   said Peter  and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room  But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it  into the library  they suddenly heard voices ahead of them  and realised that Mrs  Macready must be bringing her party of sight seers up the back stairs instead of up the front stairs as they had expected  And after that whether it was that they lost their heads  or that Mrs  Macready was trying to catch them  or that some magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere  until at last Susan said   Oh bother those trippers  Here let s get into the Wardrobe Room till they ve passed  No one will follow us in there   But the moment they were inside they heard voices in the passage and then someone fumbling at the door and then they saw the handle turning    Quick   said Peter   there s nowhere else   and flung open the wardrobe  All four of them bundled inside it and sat there  panting  in the dark  Peter held the door closed but did not shut it  for  of course  he remembered  as every sensible person does  that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe       CHAPTER VI  Into the Forest   I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away   said Susan presently   I m getting horribly cramped     And what a filthy smell of camphor   said Edmund    I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it   said Susan   to keep away moths     There s something sticking into my back   said Peter    And isn t it cold   said Susan    Now that you mention it  it is cold   said Peter   and hang it all  it s wet too  What s the matter with this place  I m sitting on something wet  It s getting wetter every minute   He struggled to his feet    Let s get out   said Edmund   they ve gone     O o oh   said Susan suddenly  And everyone asked her what was the matter    I m sitting against a tree   said Susan   and look  It s getting lighter over there     By jove  you re right   said Peter   and look there and there  It s trees all round  And this wet stuff is snow  Why  I do believe we ve got into Lucy s wood after all    And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day  Behind them were coats hanging on pegs  in front of them were snow covered trees   Peter turned at once to Lucy    I apologise for not believing you   he said   I m sorry  Will you shake hands     Of course   said Lucy  and did    And now   said Susan   what do we do next     Do   said Peter   why  go and explore the wood  of course     Ugh   said Susan  stamping her feet   it s pretty cold  What about putting on some of these coats     They re not ours   said Peter doubtfully    I am sure nobody would mind   said Susan   It isn t as if we wanted to take them out of the house  we shan t take them even out of the wardrobe     I never thought of that  Su   said Peter   Of course  now you put it that way  I see  No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it  And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe    They immediately carried out Susan s very sensible plan  The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on  But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get up and more suitable to the landscape    We can pretend we are Arctic explorers   said Lucy    This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending   said Peter  as he began leading the way forward into the forest  There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night    I say   began Edmund presently   oughtn t we to be bearing a bit more to the left  that is  if we are aiming for the lamp post   He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before  The moment the words were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away  Everyone stopped  everyone stared at him  Peter whistled    So you really were here   he said   that time Lu said she d met you in here and you made out she was telling lies    There was a dead silence   Well  of all the poisonous little beasts   said Peter and shrugged his shoulders and said no more  There seemed  indeed  no more to say and presently the four resumed their journey  but Edmund was saying to himself   I ll pay you all out for this  you pack of stuck up  self satisfied prigs     Where are we going anyway   said Susan  chiefly for the sake of changing the subject    I think Lu ought to be the leader   said Peter   goodness knows she deserves it  Where will you take us  Lu     What about going to see Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy   He s the nice Faun I told you about    Everyone agreed to this and off they went  walking briskly and stamping their feet  Lucy proved a good leader  At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way  but she recognised an odd looking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr  Tumnus  cave  But there a terrible surprise awaited them   The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits  Inside  the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days  Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor  mixed with something black  which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire  Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out  The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun s father had been slashed into shreds with a knife    This is a pretty good wash out   said Edmund   not much good coming here     What s this   said Peter  stooping down  He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor    Is there anything written on it   asked Susan    Yes  I think there is   answered Peter   but I can t read it in this light  Let s get out into the open air    They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words       The former occupant of these premises  the Faun Tumnus  is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis  Queen of Narnia  Chatelaine of Cair Paravel  Empress of the Lone Islands  etc   also of comforting her said Majesty s enemies  harbouring spies and fraternising with Humans   Signed FENRIS ULF  Captain of the Secret Police   LONG LIVE THE QUEEN      The children stared at each other    I don t know that I m going to like this place after all   said Susan    Who is this Queen  Lu   said Peter   Do you know anything about her     She isn t a real queen at all   answered Lucy   she s a horrible witch  the White Witch  Everyone all the wood people hate her  She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas     I I wonder if there s any point in going on   said Susan   I mean  it doesn t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won t be much fun either  And it s getting colder every minute  and we ve brought nothing to eat  What about just going home     Oh  but we can t  we can t   said Lucy suddenly   Don t you see  We can t just go home  not after this  It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble  He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back  That s what it means by comforting the Queen s enemies and fraternising with Humans  We simply must try to rescue him     A lot we could do   said Edmund   when we haven t even got anything to eat     Shut up you   said Peter  who was still very angry with Edmund   What do you think  Susan     I ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right   said Susan   I don t want to go a step further and I wish we d never come  But I think we must try to do something for Mr  Whatever his name is I mean the Faun     That s what I feel too   said Peter   I m worried about having no food with us  I d vote for going back and getting something from the larder  only there doesn t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you ve got out of it  I think we ll have to go on     So do I   said both the girls    If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned   said Peter   They were all still  wondering what to do next  when Lucy said   Look  There s a robin  with such a red breast  It s the first bird I ve seen here  I say  I wonder can birds talk in Narnia  It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us   Then she turned to the Robin and said   Please  can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to   As she said this she took a step towards the bird  It at once hopped away but only as far as to the next tree  There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying  Almost without noticing that they had done so  the four children went a step or two nearer to it  At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard   You couldn t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye     Do you know   said Lucy   I really believe he means us to follow him     I ve an idea he does   said Susan   what do you think  Peter     Well  we might as well try it   answered Peter   The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly  It kept going from tree to tree  always a few yards ahead of them but always so near that they could easily follow it  In this way it led them on  slightly down hill  Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch  Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright  They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour  with the two girls in front  when Edmund said to Peter   If you re not still too high and mighty to talk to me  I ve something to say which you d better listen to     What is it   asked Peter    Hush  Not so loud   said Edmund   there s no good frightening the girls  But have you realised what we re doing     What   said Peter  lowering his voice to a whisper    We re following a guide we know nothing about  How do we know which side that bird is on  Why shouldn t it be leading us into a trap     That s a nasty idea  Still a robin you know  They re good birds in all the stories I ve ever read  I m sure a robin wouldn t be on the wrong side     If it comes to that  which is the right side  How do we know that the fauns are in the right and the Queen  yes  I know we ve been told she s a witch  is in the wrong  We don t really know anything about either     The Faun saved Lucy     He said he did  But how do we know  And there s another thing too  Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here     Great Scott   said Peter   I hadn t thought of that     And no chance of dinner either   said Edmund       CHAPTER VII  A Day with the Beavers  While the two boys were whispering behind  both the girls suddenly cried  Oh   and stopped   The robin   cried Lucy   the robin  It s flown away   And so it had right out of sight    And now what are we to do   said Edmund  giving Peter a look which was as much as to say  What did I tell you     Sh  Look   said Susan    What   said Peter    There s something moving among the trees over there to the left    They all stared as hard as they could  and no one felt very comfortable    There it goes again   said Susan presently    I saw it that time too   said Peter   It s still there  It s just gone behind that big tree     What is it   asked Lucy  trying very hard not to sound nervous    Whatever it is   said Peter   it s dodging us  It s something that doesn t want to be seen     Let s go home   said Susan  And then  though nobody said it out loud  everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter  They were lost    What s it like   said Lucy    It s it s a kind of animal   said Susan  and then   Look  Look  Quick  There it is    They all saw it this time  a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree  But this time it didn t immediately draw back  Instead  the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their finger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet  Then it disappeared again  The children all stood holding their breaths   A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree  glanced all round as if it were afraid someone was watching  said  Hush   made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing  and then once more disappeared    I know what it is   said Peter   it s a beaver  I saw the tail     It wants us to go to it   said Susan   and it is warning us not to make a noise     I know   said Peter   The question is are we to go to it or not  What do you think  Lu     I think it s a nice beaver   said Lucy    Yes  but how do we know   said Edmund    Shan t we have to risk it   said Susan   I mean  it s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner    At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them    Come on   said Peter   let s give it a try  All keep close together  We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy    So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it  and there  sure enough  they found the Beaver  but it still drew back  saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper   Further in  come further in  Right in here  We re not safe in the open   Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there  did it begin to talk to them    Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve   it said    We re some of them   said Peter    S s s sh   said the Beaver   not so loud please  We re not safe even here     Why  who are you afraid of   said Peter   There s no one here but ourselves     There are the trees   said the Beaver   They re always listening  Most of them are on our side  but there are trees that would betray us to her  you know who I mean   and it nodded its head several times    If it comes to talking about sides   said Edmund   how do we know you re a friend     Not meaning to be rude  Mr  Beaver   added Peter   but you see  we re strangers     Quite right  quite right   said the Beaver   Here is my token   With these words it held up to them a little white object  They all looked at it in surprise  till suddenly Lucy said   Oh  of course  It s my handkerchief the one I gave to poor Mr  Tumnus     That s right   said the Beaver   Poor fellow  he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me  He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to   Here the Beaver s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods  Then signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could  so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers  it added in a low whisper    They say Aslan is on the move perhaps has already landed    And now a very curious thing happened  None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do  but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different  Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don t understand but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words  which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again  It was like that now  At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in his inside  Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror  Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous  Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her  And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer    And what about Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy   where is he     S s s sh   said the Beaver   not here  I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner    No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the Beaver now and everyone  including Edmund  was very glad to hear the word  dinner   They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace  and always in the thickest parts of the forest  for over an hour  Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply down hill  A minute later they came out under the open sky  the sun was still shining  and found themselves looking down on a fine sight   They were standing on the edge of a steep  narrow valley at the bottom of which ran at least it would have been running if it hadn t been frozen a fairly large river  Just below them a dam had been built across this river  and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr  Beaver had made this one  They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they ve made or reading a story they ve written  So it was only common politeness when Susan said   What a lovely dam   And Mr  Beaver didn t say  Hush  this time but  Merely a trifle  Merely a trifle  And it isn t really finished    Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now of course a level floor of dark green ice  And below the dam  much lower down  was more ice  but instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came  And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles  as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar  And out in the middle  and partly on the top of the dam  was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous bee hive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up  so that when you saw it  especially if you were hungry  you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before   That was what the others chiefly noticed  but Edmund noticed something else  A little lower down the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it  And looking up that valley  Edmund could see two small hills  and he was almost sure they were the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp post that other day  And then between them  he thought  must be her palace  only a mile off or less  And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King   And I wonder how Peter will like that   he asked himself  and horrible ideas came into his head    Here we are   said Mr  Beaver   and it looks as if Mrs  Beaver is expecting us  I ll lead the way  But be careful and don t slip    The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on  though not  for humans  a very nice place to walk because it was covered with ice  and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side  there was a nasty drop to the lower river on the other  Along this route Mr  Beaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it  And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house    Here we are  Mrs  Beaver   said Mr  Beaver   I ve found them  Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve  and they all went in   The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound  and the first thing she saw was a kind looking old she beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine and it was from it that the sound came  She stopped her work and got up as soon as the children came in    So you ve come at last   she said  holding out both her wrinkled old paws   At last  To think that ever I should live to see this day  The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle s singing and I daresay  Mr  Beaver  you ll get us some fish     That I will   said Mr  Beaver and he went out of the house  Peter went with him  and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet  They took a pail with them  Mr  Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole  he didn t seem to mind it s being so chilly  looked hard into it  then suddenly shot in his paw  and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout  Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish   Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs  Beaver to fill the the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr  Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house  and to put on the frying pan and get the dripping hot  Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr  Tumnus s cave  There were no books or pictures and instead of beds there were bunks  like on board ship  built into the wall  And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof and against the walls were gum boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fishing rods and fishing nets and sacks  And the cloth on the table tho  very clean was very rough   Just as the frying pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr  Beaver came in with the fish which Mr  Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air  You can think how good the new caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mrs  Beaver said   Now we re nearly ready   Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs  Beaver to dish up the trout  so that in a very few minutes everyone was drawing up stools  it was all three legged stools in the Beavers  house except for Mrs  Beaver s own special rocking chair beside the fire  and preparing to enjoy themselves  There was a jug of creamy milk for the children  Mr  Beaver stuck to beer  and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes and all the children thought and I agree with them that there s nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan half a minute ago  And when they had finished the fish Mrs  Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll  steaming hot  and at the same time moved the kettle on to the fire  so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to be poured out  And when each person had got his  or her  cup of tea  each person shoved back his  or her  stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment    And now   said Mr  Beaver pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him   if you ll just wait till I ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely why  now we can get to business  It s snowing again   he added  cocking his eye at the window   That s all the better  because it means we shan t have any visitors  and if anyone should have been trying to follow you  why he won t find any tracks        CHAPTER VIII  What Happened after Dinner   And now   said Lucy   do please tell us what s happened to Mr  Tumnus     Ah  that s bad   said Mr  Beaver shaking his head   That s a very  very bad business  There s no doubt he was taken off by the police  I got that from a bird who saw it done     But where s he been taken to   asked Lucy    Well  they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means     No  we don t   said Susan  But Mr  Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion    I m afraid it means they were taking him to her house   said Mr  Beaver    But what ll they do to him  Mr  Beaver   gasped Lucy    Well   said Mr  Beaver   you can t exactly say for sure  But there s not many taken in there that ever comes out again  Statues  All full of statues they say it is in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall  People she s turned    he paused and shuddered   turned into stone     But  Mr  Beaver   said Lucy   can t we I mean we must do something to save him  It s too dreadful and it s all on my account     I don t doubt you d save him if you could  dearie   said Mrs  Beaver   but you ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive     Couldn t we have some stratagem   said Peter   I mean couldn t we dress up as something  or pretend to be oh  pedlars or anything or watch till she was gone out or oh  hang it all  there must be some way  This Faun saved my sister at his own risk  Mr  Beaver  We can t just leave him to be to be to have that done to him     It s no good  Son of Adam   said Mr  Beaver   no good your trying  of all people  But now that Aslan is on the move     Oh  yes  Tell us about Aslan   said several voices at once  for once again that strange feeling like the first signs of spring  like good news  had come over them    Who is Aslan   asked Susan    Aslan   said Mr  Beaver   Why don t you know  He s the King  He s the Lord of the whole wood  but not often here  you understand  Never in my time or my father s time  But the word has reached us that he has come back  He is in Narnia at this moment  He ll settle the White Queen all right  It is he  not you  that will save Mr  Tumnus     She won t turn him into stone too   said Edmund    Lord love you  Son of Adam  what a simple thing to say   answered Mr  Beaver with a great laugh   Turn him into stone  If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her  No  no  He ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts    Wrong will be right  when Aslan comes in sight  At the sound of his roar  sorrows will be no more  When he bares his teeth  winter meets its death And when he shakes his mane  we shall have spring again   You ll understand when you see him     But shall we see him   asked Susan    Why  Daughter of Eve  that s what I brought you here for  I m to lead you where you shall meet him   said Mr  Beaver    Is is he a man   asked Lucy    Aslan a man   said Mr  Beaver sternly   Certainly not  I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor Beyond the Sea  Don t you know who is the King of Beasts  Aslan is a lion the Lion  the great Lion     Ooh   said Susan   I d thought he was a man  Is he quite safe  I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion     That you will  dearie  and no mistake   said Mrs  Beaver   if there s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking  they re either braver than most or else just silly     Then he isn t safe   said Lucy    Safe   said Mr  Beaver   Don t you hear what Mrs  Beaver tells you  Who said anything about safe   Course he isn t safe  But he s good  He s the King  I tell you     I m longing to see him   said Peter   even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point     That s right  Son of Adam   said Mr  Beaver bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle   And so you shall  Word has been sent that you are to meet him  to morrow if you can  at the Stone Table     Where s that   said Lucy    I ll show you   said Mr  Beaver   It s down the river  a good step from here  I ll take you to it     But meanwhile what about poor Mr  Tumnus   said Lucy    The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan   said Mr  Beaver   once he s with us  then we can begin doing things  Not that we don t need you too  For that s another of the old rhymes    When Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Sits at Cair Paravel in throne  The evil time will be over and done   So things must be drawing near their end now he s come and you ve come  We ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before long ago  nobody can say when  But there s never been any of your race here before     That s what I don t understand  Mr  Beaver   said Peter   I mean isn t the Witch herself human     She d like us to believe it   said Mr  Beaver   and it s on that that she bases her claim to be Queen  But she s no Daughter of Eve  She comes of your father Adam s    here Mr  Beaver bowed   your father Adam s first wife  her they called Lilith  And she was one of the Jinn  That s what she comes from on one side  And on the other she comes of the giants  No  no  there isn t a drop of real Human blood in the Witch     That s why she s bad all through  Mr  Beaver   said Mrs  Beaver    True enough  Mrs  Beaver   replied he   there may be two views about Humans  meaning no offence to the present company   But there s no two views about things that look like Humans and aren t     I ve known good dwarfs   said Mrs  Beaver    So ve I  now you come to speak of it   said her husband   but precious few  and they were the ones least like men  But in general  take my advice  when you meet anything that s going to be Human and isn t yet  or used to be Human once and isn t now  or ought to be Human and isn t  you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet  And that s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia  She s been watching for you this many a year  and if she knew there were four of you she d be more dangerous still     What s that to do with it   asked Peter    Because of another prophecy   said Mr  Beaver   Down at Cair Paravel that s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones  then it will be the end not only of the White Witch s reign but of her life  and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along  for if she knew about you four  your lives wouldn t be worth a shake of my whiskers    All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr  Beaver was telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time  Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark  Lucy suddenly said    I say where s Edmund    There was a dreadful pause  and then everyone began asking  Who saw him last  How long has he been missing  Is he outside   And then all rushed to the door and looked out  The snow was falling thickly and steadily  the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket  and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank  Out they went  plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow  and went round the house in every direction   Edmund  Edmund   they called till they were hoarse  But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer    How perfectly dreadful   said Susan as they at last came back in despair   Oh  how I wish we d never come     What on earth are we to do  Mr  Beaver   said Peter    Do   said Mr  Beaver who was already putting on his snow boots   do  We must be off at once  We haven t a moment to spare     We d better divide into four search parties   said Peter   and all go in different directions  Whoever finds him must come back here at once and     Search parties  Son of Adam   said Mr  Beaver   what for     Why  to look for Edmund of course     There s no point in looking for him   said Mr  Beaver    What do you mean   said Susan   he can t be far away yet  And we ve got to find him  What do you mean when you say there s no use looking for him     The reason there s no use looking   said Mr  Beaver   is that we know already where he s gone   Everyone stared in amazement   Don t you understand   said Mr  Beaver   He s gone to her  to the White Witch  He has betrayed us all     Oh surely oh really   said Susan   he can t have done that     Can t he   said Mr  Beaver looking very hard at the three children  and everything they wanted to say died on their lips for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done    But will he know the way   said Peter    Has he been in this country before   asked Mr  Beaver   has he ever been here alone     Yes   said Lucy almost in a whisper   I m afraid he has     And did he tell you what he d done or who he d met     Well  no  he didn t   said Peter    Then mark my words   said Mr  Beaver   he has already met the White Witch and joined her side  and been told where she lives  I didn t like to mention it before  he being your brother and all  but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself  Treacherous   He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food  You can always tell them if you ve lived long in Narnia  something about their eyes     All the same   said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice   we ll still have to go and look for him  He is our brother after all  even if he is rather a little beast  and he s only a kid     Go to the Witch s house   said Mrs  Beaver   Don t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her     How do you mean   said Lucy    Why all she wants is to get all four of you  she s thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel   Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done and there d be four new statues in her collection before you d had time to speak  But she ll keep him alive as long as he s the only one she s got  because she ll want to use him as a decoy  as bait to catch the rest of you with     Oh  can no one help us   wailed Lucy    Only Aslan   said Mr  Beaver   we must go on and meet him  That s our only chance now     It seems to me  my dears   said Mrs  Beaver   that it is very important to know just when he slipped away  How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard  For instance  had we started talking of Aslan before he left  If not  then we may do very well  for she won t know that Aslan has come to Narnia  or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned     I don t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan   began Peter  but Lucy interrupted him    Oh yes  he was   she said miserably   don t you remember  it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn t turn Aslan into stone too     So he did  by Jove   said Peter   just the sort of thing he would say  too     Worse and worse   said Mr  Beaver   and the next thing is this  Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table    And of course no one knew the answer to this question    Because  if he was   continued Mr  Beaver   then she ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down  In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan     But that isn t what she ll do first   said Mrs  Beaver   not if I know her  The moment that Edmund tells her that we re all here she ll set out to catch us this very night  and if he s been gone about half an hour  she ll be here in about another twenty minutes     You re right  Mrs  Beaver   said her husband   we must all get away from here  There s not a moment to lose        CHAPTER IX  In the Witch s House  And now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund  He had eaten his share of the dinner  but he hadn t really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight and there s nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food  And he had heard the conversation and hadn t enjoyed it much either  because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder  They weren t  but he imagined it  And then he had listened until Mr  Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table  It was then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door  For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling   Just as Mr  Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door handle  and just before Mr  Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn t really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess  Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him   You mustn t think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone  He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince  and later a King  and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast  As for what the Witch would do with the others  he didn t want her to be particularly nice to them certainly not to put them on the same level as himself but he managed to believe  or to pretend he believed  that she wouldn t do anything very bad to them   Because   he said to himself   all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn t true  She was jolly nice to me  anyway  much nicer than they are  I expect she is the rightful Queen really  Anyway  she ll be better than that awful Aslan   At least  that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing  It wasn t a very good excuse  however  for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel   The first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all around him  was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers  house  And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now  The next thing he realised was that the daylight was almost gone  for it had been nearly three o clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short  He hadn t reckoned on this  but he had to make the best of it  So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam  luckily it wasn t so slippery since the snow had fallen  to the far side of the river   It was pretty bad when he reached the far side  It was growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead  And then too there was no road  He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow  and skidding on frozen puddles  and tripping over fallen tree trunks  and sliding down steep banks  and barking his shins against rocks  till he was wet and cold and bruised all over  The silence and the loneliness were dreadful  In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others  if he hadn t happened to say to himself   When I m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads   And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal  He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place  when the weather changed  First the snow stopped  Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold  Finally  the clouds rolled away and the moon came out  It was a full moon and  shining on all that snow  it made everything almost as bright as day only the shadows were rather confusing   He would never have found his way if the moon hadn t come out by the time he got to the other river you remember he had seen  when they first arrived at the Beavers   a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down  He now reached this and turned to follow it up  But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bushes  so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark  Even as it was  he got wet through for he had to stoop to go under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back  And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter just as if all this had been Peter s fault   But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out  And there  on the other side of the river  quite close to him  in the middle of a little plain between two hills  he saw what must be the White Witch s house  And the moon was shining brighter than ever  The house was really a small castle  It seemed to be all towers  little towers with long pointed spires on them  sharp as needles  They looked like huge dunce s caps or sorcerer s caps  And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow  Edmund began to be afraid of the house   But it was too late to think of turning back now  He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the house  There was nothing stirring  not the slightest sound anywhere  Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow  He walked on and on  past corner after corner of the house  and past turret after turret to find the door  He had to go right round to the far side before he found it  It was a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open   Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard  and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating  Just inside the gate  with the moonlight shining on it  stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring  And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch  afraid to go on and afraid to go back  with his knees knocking together  He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear  How long this really lasted I don t know  but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours   Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still for it hadn t moved one inch since he first set eyes on it  Edmund now ventured a little nearer  still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could  He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn t have been looking at him at all    But supposing it turns its head   thought Edmund   In fact it was staring at something else namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away   Aha   thought Edmund   When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape   But still the lion never moved  nor did the dwarf  And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone  Perhaps this was only a stone lion  And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion s back and the top of its head were covered with snow  Of course it must be only a statue  No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow  Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst  Edmund ventured to go up to the lion  Even now he hardly dared to touch it  but at last he put out his hand  very quickly  and did  It was cold stone  He had been frightened of a mere statue   The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes  and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea   Probably   he thought   this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about  She s caught him already and turned him into stone  So that s the end of all their fine ideas about him  Pooh  Who s afraid of Aslan    And he stood there gloating over the stone lion  and presently he did something very silly and childish  He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion s upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes  Then he said   Yah  Silly old Aslan  How do you like being a stone  You thought yourself mighty fine  didn t you   But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible  and sad  and noble  staring up in the moonlight that Edmund didn t really get any fun out of jeering at it  He turned away and began to cross the courtyard   As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess board when it is half way through the game  There were stone satyrs  and stone wolves  and bears and foxes and cat a mountains of stone  There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees  There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon  They all looked so strange standing there perfectly lifelike and also perfectly still  in the bright cold moonlight  that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard  Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man  but as tall as a tree  with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand  Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one  Edmund did not like going past it   He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard  He went to it  there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door  Edmund went up them  Across the threshold lay a great wolf    It s all right  it s all right   he kept saying to himself   it s only a stone wolf  It can t hurt me   and he raised his leg to step over it  Instantly the huge creature rose  with all the hair bristling along its back  opened a great  red mouth and said in a growling voice    Who s there  Who s there  Stand still  stranger  and tell me who you are     If you please  Sir   said Edmund  trembling so that he could hardly speak   my name is Edmund  and I m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia quite close  in the Beavers  house  She she wanted to see them     I will tell Her Majesty   said the Wolf   Meanwhile  stand still on the threshold  as you value your life   Then it vanished into the house   Edmund stood and waited  his fingers aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest  and presently the grey Wolf  Fenris Ulf  the Chief of the Witch s Secret Police  came bounding back and said   Come in  Come in  Fortunate favourite of the Queen or else not so fortunate    And Edmund went in  taking great care not to tread on the Wolf s paws   He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars  full  as the courtyard had been  of statues  The one nearest the door was a little Faun with a very sad expression on its face  and Edmund couldn t help wondering if this might be Lucy s friend  The only light came from a single lamp and close behind this sat the White Witch    I m come  your Majesty   said Edmund rushing eagerly forward    How dare you come alone   said the Witch in a terrible voice   Did I not tell you to bring the others with you     Please  your Majesty   said Edmund   I ve done the best I can  I ve brought them quite close  They re in the little house on top of the dam just up the river with Mr  and Mrs  Beaver    A slow cruel smile came over the Witch s face    Is this all your news   she asked    No  your Majesty   said Edmund  and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers  house    What  Aslan   cried the Queen   Aslan  Is this true  If I find you have lied to me     Please  I m only repeating what they said   stammered Edmund   But the Queen  who was no longer attending to him  clapped her hands  Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared    Make ready our sledge   ordered the Witch   and use the harness without bells        CHAPTER X  The Spell Begins to Break  Now we must go back to Mr  and Mrs  Beaver and the three other children  As soon as Mr  Beaver said  There s no time to lose  everyone began bundling themselves into coats  except Mrs  Beaver who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said   Now  Mr  Beaver  just reach down that ham  And here s a packet of tea  and there s sugar  and some matches  And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner     What are you doing  Mrs  Beaver   exclaimed Susan    Packing a load for each of us  dearie   said Mrs  Beaver very coolly   You didn t think we d set out on a journey with nothing to eat  did you     But we haven t time   said Susan  buttoning the collar of her coat   She may be here any minute     That s what I say   chimed in Mr  Beaver    Get along with you all   said his wife   Think it over  Mr  Beaver  She can t be here for a quarter of an hour at least     But don t we want as big a start as we can possibly get   said Peter   if we re to reach the Stone Table before her     You ve got to remember that  Mrs  Beaver   said Susan   As soon as she has looked in here and finds we re gone she ll be off at top speed     That she will   said Mrs  Beaver   But we can t get there before her whatever we do  for she ll be on a sledge and we ll be walking     Then have we no hope   said Susan    Now don t you get fussing  there s a dear   said Mrs  Beaver   but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of that drawer   Course we ve got a hope  We can t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she won t expect and perhaps we ll get through     That s true enough  Mrs  Beaver   said her husband   But it s time we were out of this     And don t you start fussing either  Mr  Beaver   said his wife   There  That s better  There s four loads and the smallest for the smallest of us  that s you  my dear   she added looking at Lucy    Oh  do please come on   said Lucy    Well  I m nearly ready now   answered Mrs  Beaver at last allowing her husband to help her into her snow boots   I suppose the sewing machine s too heavy to bring     Yes  It is   said Mr  Beaver   A great deal too heavy  And you don t think you ll be able to use it while we re on the run  I suppose     I can t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it   said Mrs  Beaver   and breaking it or stealing it  as likely as not     Oh  please  please  please  do hurry   said the three children  And so at last they all got outside and Mr  Beaver locked the door   It ll delay her a bit   he said  and they set off  all carrying their loads over their shoulders   The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey  They went in single file first Mr  Beaver  then Lucy  then Peter  then Susan  and Mrs  Beaver last of all  Mr  Beaver led them across the dam and onto the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river bank  The sides of the valley  shining in the moonlight  towered up far above them on either hand   Best keep down here as much as possible   he said   She ll have to keep to the top  for you couldn t bring a sledge down here    It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair  and even as things were  Lucy enjoyed it at first  But as they went on walking and walking and walking and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier  she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all  And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr  Beaver going pad pad pad pad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop  Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more  And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr  Beaver had turned away from the river bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes  And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr  Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it  In fact  by the time she realised what was happening  only his short flat tail was showing   Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him  Then she heard noises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside    Wherever is this   said Peter s voice  sounding tired and pale in the darkness   I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale     It s an old hiding place for beavers in bad times   said Mr  Beaver   and a great secret  It s not much of a place but we must get a few hours  sleep     If you hadn t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting  I d have brought some pillows   said Mrs  Beaver   It wasn t nearly such a nice cave as Mr  Tumnus s  Lucy thought just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy  It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of fur and clothes together  and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug  If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother  Then Mrs  Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you d swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep   It seemed to Lucy only the next minute  though really it was hours and hours later  when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath  Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave  But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed  and so was everyone else  In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open  listening to a sound which was the very sound they d all been thinking of  and sometimes imagining they heard  during their walk last night  It was a sound of jingling bells   Mr  Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it  Perhaps you think  as Lucy thought for a moment  that this was a very silly thing for him to do  But it was really a very sensible one  He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen  and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch s sledge went  The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering  They waited nearly five minutes  Then they heard something that frightened them very much  They heard voices   Oh   thought Lucy   he s been seen  She s caught him    Great was their surprise when  a little later  they heard Mr  Beaver s voice calling to them from just outside the cave    It s all right   he was shouting   Come out  Mrs  Beaver  Come out  Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve  It s all right  It isn t her   This was bad grammar of course  but that is how beavers talk when they are excited  I mean  in Narnia in our world they usually don t talk at all   So Mrs  Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave  all blinking in the daylight  and with earth all over them  and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes    Come on   cried Mr  Beaver  who was almost dancing with delight   Come and see  This is a nasty knock for the Witch  It looks as if her power was already crumbling     What do you mean  Mr  Beaver   panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together    Didn t I tell you   answered Mr  Beaver   that she d made it always winter and never Christmas  Didn t I tell you  Well  just come and see    And then they were all at the top and did see   It was a sledge  and it was reindeer with bells on their harness  But they were far bigger than the Witch s reindeer  and they were not white but brown  And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him  He was a huge man in a bright red robe  bright as holly berries  with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest  Everyone knew him because  though you see people of his sort only in Narnia  you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world the world on this side of the wardrobe door  But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different  Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly  But now that the children actually stood looking at him they didn t find it quite like that  He was so big  and so glad  and so real  that they all became quite still  They felt very glad  but also solemn    I ve come at last   said he   She has kept me out for a long time  but I have got in at last  Aslan is on the move  The Witch s magic is weakening    And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still    And now   said Father Christmas   for your presents  There is a new and better sewing machine for you  Mrs  Beaver  I will drop it in your house as I pass     If you please  sir   said Mrs  Beaver  making a curtsey   It s locked up     Locks and bolts make no difference to me   said Father Christmas   And as for you  Mr  Beaver  when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice gate fitted    Mr  Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn t say anything at all    Peter  Adam s Son   said Father Christmas    Here  Sir   said Peter    These are your presents   was the answer   and they are tools not toys  The time to use them is perhaps near at hand  Bear them well   With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword  The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion  as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it  The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed  and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use  Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts for he felt they were a very serious kind of present    Susan  Eve s Daughter   said Father Christmas   These are for you   and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn   You must use the bow only in great need   he said   for I do not mean you to fight in the battle  It does not easily miss  And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it  then  wherever you are  I think help of some kind will come to you    Last of all he said   Lucy  Eve s Daughter   and Lucy came forward  He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass  but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond  and a small dagger   In this bottle   he said   there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire flowers that grow in the mountains of the sun  If you or any of your friends are hurt  a few drops of this will restore you  And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need  For you also are not to be in the battle     Why  Sir   said Lucy   I think I don t know but I think I could be brave enough     That is not the point   he said   But battles are ugly when women fight  And now  here he suddenly looked less grave  here is something for the moment for you all   and he brought out  I suppose from the big bag at his back  but nobody quite saw him do it  a large tray containing five cups and saucers  a bowl of lump sugar  a jug of cream  and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot  Then he cried out  A Merry Christmas  Long live the true King   and cracked his whip and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started   Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr  Beaver when Mrs  Beaver said    Now then  now then  Don t stand talking there till the tea s got cold  Just like men  Come and help to carry the tray down and we ll have breakfast  What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread knife    So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave  and Mr  Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs  Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed himself  But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr  Beaver said   Time to be moving on now        CHAPTER XI  Aslan Is Nearer  Edmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time  When the Dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him  as she had been at their last meeting  But she said nothing at all  And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say   Please  your Majesty  could I have some Turkish Delight  You you said   she answered   Silence  fool   Then she appeared to change her mind and said  as if to herself   And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way   and once more clapped her hands  Another dwarf appeared   Bring the human creature food and drink   she said  The Dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it  He grinned in a repulsive manner as he set them down the floor beside Edmund and said    Turkish Delight for the little Prince  Ha  Ha  Ha     Take it away   said Edmund sulkily   I don t want dry bread   But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologised and began to nibble at the bread  though it was so stale he could hardly get it down    You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again   said the Witch   While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge was ready  The White Witch rose and went out  ordering Edmund to go with her  The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge  But before they drove off she called Fenris Ulf and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge    Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers   said the Witch   and kill whatever you find there  If they are already gone  then make all speed to the Stone Table  but do not be seen  Wait for me there in hiding  I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river  You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table  You will know what to do if you find them     I hear and obey  O Queen   growled the Wolf  and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness  as quickly as a horse can gallop  In a few minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam and sniffing at the Beavers  house  But of course they found it empty  It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine  for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave  But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up   Meanwhile the Dwarf whipped up the reindeer and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold  This was a terrible journey for Edmund who had no coat  Before they had been going a quarter of ah hour all the front of him was covered with snow he soon stopped trying to shake it off because  as quickly as he did that  a new lot gathered  and he was so tired  Soon he was wet to the skin  And oh  how miserable he was  It didn t look now as if the Witch intended to make him a King  All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now  He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment even Peter  The only way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he might wake up at any moment  And as they went on  hour after hour  it did come to seem like a dream   This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it  But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight  And still they went on and on  with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer s harness  And then at last the Witch said   What have we here  Stop   and they did   How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast  But she had stopped for quite a different reason  A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party  a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dog fox  all on stools round a table  Edmund couldn t quite see what they were eating  but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn t at all sure that he didn t see something like a plum pudding  At the moment when the sledge stopped  the Fox  who was obviously the oldest person present  had just risen to its feet  holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something  But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was in it  all the gaiety went out of their faces  The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half way to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its mouth  and the baby squirrels squealed with terror    What is the meaning of this   asked the Witch Queen  Nobody answered    Speak  vermin   she said again   Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip  What is the meaning of all this gluttony  this waste  this self indulgence  Where did you get all these things     Please  your Majesty   said the Fox   we were given them  And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty s very good health     Who gave them to you   said the Witch    F F F Father Christmas   stammered the Fox    What   roared the Witch  springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer to the terrified animals   He has not been here  He cannot have been here  How dare you but no  Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven    At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely    He has he has he has   it squeaked beating its little spoon on the table  Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek  Then she raised her wand   Oh don t  don t  please don t   shouted Edmund  but even while he was shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures  one with its stone fork fixed forever half way to its stone mouth  seated round a stone table on which there were stone plates and a stone plum pudding    As for you   said the Witch  giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re mounted the sledge   let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors  Drive on   And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself  It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights  year after year  till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces crumbled away   Now they were steadily racing on again  And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night  At the same time he noticed that he was feeling much less cold  It was also becoming foggy  In fact every minute it grew both foggier and warmer  And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up till now  At first he thought this was because the reindeer were tired  but soon he saw that that couldn t be the real reason  The sledge jerked  and skidded  and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones  And however the Dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower  There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them but the noise of their driving and jolting and the Dwarf s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was  until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn t go on at all  When that happened there was a moment s silence  And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly  A strange  sweet  rustling  chattering noise and yet not so strange  for he knew he d heard it before if only he could remember where  Then all at once he did remember  It was the noise of running water  All round them  though out of sight  there were streams chattering  murmuring  bubbling  splashing and even  in the distance  roaring  And his heart gave a great leap  though he hardly knew why  when he realised that the frost was over  And much nearer there was a drip drip drip from the branches of all the trees  And then  as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree  But he hadn t time to listen or watch any longer for the Witch said    Don t sit staring  fool  Get out and help    And of course Edmund had to obey  He stepped out into the snow but it was really only slush by now and began helping the Dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into  They got it out in the end  and by being very cruel to the reindeer the Dwarf managed to get it on the move again  and they drove a little further  And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction  Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it  you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white  Then the sledge stopped again    It s no good  your Majesty   said the Dwarf   We can t sledge in this thaw     Then we must walk   said the Witch    We shall never overtake them walking   growled the dwarf   Not with the start they ve got     Are you my councillor or my slave   said the Witch   Do as you re told  Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope  And take your whip  And cut the harness of the reindeer  they ll find their own way home    The Dwarf obeyed  and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him  He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass  and every time he slipped the Dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip  The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying   Faster  Faster    Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of snow grew smaller  Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow  Soon  wherever you looked  instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms  Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether  Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree tops   Soon there were more wonderful things happening  Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers celandines  The noise of water grew louder  Presently they actually crossed a stream  Beyond it they found snowdrops growing    Mind your own business   said the Dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them  and he gave the rope a vicious jerk   But of course this didn t prevent Edmund from seeing  Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree gold and purple and white  Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water  Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree  It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off  And then  as if that had been a signal  there was chattering and chirruping in every direction  and then a moment of full song  and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds  music  and wherever Edmund s eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches  or sailing overhead or having their little quarrels    Faster  Faster   said the Witch   There was no trace of the fog now  The sky became bluer and bluer and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time  In the wide glades there were primroses  A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool  delicious scents against the faces of the travellers  The trees began to come fully alive  The larches and birches were covered with green  the laburnums with gold  Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate  transparent leaves  As the travellers walked under them the light also became green  A bee buzzed across their path    This is no thaw   said the Dwarf  suddenly stopping   This is spring  What are we to do  Your winter has been destroyed  I tell you  This is Aslan s doing     If either of you mention that name again   said the Witch   he shall instantly be killed        CHAPTER XII  Peter s First Battle  While the Dwarf and the White Witch were saying this  miles away the Beaver and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream  Long ago they had left the coats behind them  And by now they had even stopped saying to one another   Look  There s a kingfisher   or  I say  bluebells   or  What was that lovely smell   or  Just listen to that thrush   They walked on in silence drinking it all in  passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool  green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead  and then into dense masses of flowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering   They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May  They hadn t even known for certain  as the Witch did  that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia  But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter  and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong  and badly wrong  with the Witch s schemes  And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge  After that they didn t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones  They were pretty tired by now of course  but not what I d call bitterly tired only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open  Susan had a slight blister on one heel   They had left the course of the big river some time ago  for one had to turn a little to the right  that meant a little to the South  to reach the place of the Stone Table  Even if this had not been their way  they couldn t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began  for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood a wonderful  roaring  thundering yellow flood and their path would have been under water   And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the flowers began to think about closing    Not long now   said Mr  Beaver  and began leading them uphill across some very deep  springy moss  it felt nice under their tired feet  in a place where only tall trees grew  very wide apart  The climb  coming at the end of the long day  made them all pant and blow  And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest  suddenly they were at the top  And this is what they saw   They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction except right ahead  There  far to the East  was something twinkling and moving   By gum   whispered Peter to Susan   The sea   In the very middle of this open hilltop was the Stone Table  It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones  It looked very old  and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language  They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them  The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place  A wonderful pavilion it was and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent pegs of ivory  and high above it on a pole a banner  which bore a red rampant lion  fluttered in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far off sea  While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right  and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see   Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves around him in the shape of a half moon  There were Tree Women there and Well Women  Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world  who had stringed instruments  it was they who had made the music  There were four great centaurs  The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses  and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants  There was also a unicorn  and a bull with the head of a man  and a pelican  and an eagle  and a great dog  And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard   But as for Aslan himself  the Beavers and the children didn t know what to do or say when they saw him  People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time  If the children had ever thought so  they were cured of it now  For when they tried to look at Aslan s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great  royal  solemn  overwhelming eyes  and then they found they couldn t look at him and went all trembly    Go on   whispered Mr  Beaver    No   whispered Peter   you first     No  Sons of Adam before animals   whispered Mr  Beaver back again    Susan   whispered Peter   what about you  Ladies first     No  you re the eldest   whispered Susan  And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt  Then at last Peter realised that it was up to him  He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others  Come on  Pull yourselves together   he advanced to the Lion and said    We have come Aslan     Welcome  Peter  Son of Adam   said Aslan   Welcome  Susan and Lucy  Daughters of Eve  Welcome He Beaver and She Beaver    His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them  They now felt glad and quiet and it didn t seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing    But where is the fourth   asked Aslan    He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch  O Aslan   said Mr  Beaver  And then something made Peter say    That was partly my fault  Aslan  I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong    And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great golden eyes  And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said    Please Aslan   said Lucy   can anything be done to save Edmund     All shall be done   said Aslan   But it may be harder than you think   And then he was silent again for some time  Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked  now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well  But next minute that expression was quite gone  The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paws together   Terrible paws   thought Lucy   If he didn t know how to velvet them    and said    Meanwhile  let the feast be prepared  Ladies  take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them    When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw and though it was velveted it was very heavy on Peter s shoulder and said   Come  Son of Adam  and I will show you a far off sight of the castle where you are to be King    And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hill top  There a beautiful sight met their eyes  The sun was setting behind their backs  That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light forest and hills and valleys and  winding away like a silver snake  the lower part of the great river  And beyond all this  miles away  was the sea  and beyond the sea the sky  full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset  But just where the land of Narnia met the sea in fact  at the mouth of the great river there was something on a little hill  shining  It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was reflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset  but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore    That  O Man   said Aslan   is Cair Paravel of the four thrones  in one of which you must sit as King  I show it to you because you are the first born and you will be High King over all the rest    And once more Peter said nothing  for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly  It was like a bugle  but richer    It is your sister s horn   said Aslan to Peter in a low voice  so low as to be almost a purr  if it is not disrespectful to think of a lion purring   For a moment Peter did not understand  Then  when he saw all the other creatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw   Back  Let the Prince win his spurs   he did understand  and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion  And there he saw a dreadful sight   The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction  Lucy was running towards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper  Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree  and swing herself up  followed by a huge grey beast  At first Peter thought it was a bear  Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian  though it was far too big to be a dog  Then he realised that it was a wolf a wolf standing on its hind legs  with its front paws against the tree trunk snapping and snarling  All the hair on its back stood up on end  Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch  One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snapping teeth  Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip  then he realised that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off   Peter did not feel very brave  indeed  he felt he was going to be sick  But that made no difference to what he had to do  He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side  That stroke never reached the Wolf  Quick as lightning it turned round  its eyes flaming  and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger  If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once  As it was though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword  as hard as he could  between the brute s forelegs into its heart  Then came a horrible  confused moment like something in a nightmare  He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead  and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead  and everything was blood and heat and hair  A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes  He felt tired all over   Then  after a bit  Susan came down the tree  She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won t say there wasn t kissing and crying on both sides  But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that    Quick  Quick   shouted the voice of Aslan   Centaurs  Eagles  I see another wolf in the thickets  There behind you  He has just darted away  After him  all of you  He will be going to his mistress  Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam   And instantly with a thunder of hoofs and a beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness   Peter  still out of breath  turned and saw Aslan close at hand    You have forgotten to clean your sword   said Aslan   It was true  Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf s hair and blood  He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass  and then wiped it quite dry on his coat    Hand it to me and kneel  Son of Adam   said Aslan  And when Peter had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said   Rise up  Sir Peter Fenris Bane  And  whatever happens  never forget to wipe your sword        CHAPTER XIII  Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time  Now we must go back to Edmund  When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk  the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew trees  Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face  doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him lie still  He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was  The Witch and the Dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones    No   said the Dwarf   it is no use now  O Queen  They must have reached the Stone Table by now     Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news   said the Witch    It cannot be good news if he does   said the Dwarf    Four thrones in Cair Paravel   said the Witch   How if only three were filled  That would not fulfil the prophecy     What difference would that make now that he is here   said the Dwarf  He did not dare  even now  to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress    He may not stay long  And then we would fall upon the three at Cair     Yet it might be better   said the Dwarf   to keep this one   here he kicked Edmund   for bargaining with     Yes  And have him rescued   said the Witch scornfully    Then   said the Dwarf   we had better do what we have to do at once     I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself   said the Witch   That is the proper place  That is where it has always been done before     It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use   said the Dwarf    True   said the Witch  and then   Well  I will begin    At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them    I have seen them  They are all at the Stone Table  with him  They have killed my captain  Fenris Ulf  I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all  One of the Sons of Adam killed him  Fly  Fly     No   said the Witch   There need be no flying  Go quickly  Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can  Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side  Call the Ghouls  and the Boggles  the Ogres and the Minotaurs  Call the Cruels  the Hags  the Spectres  and the people of the Toadstools  We will fight  What  Have I not still my wand  Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on  Be off quickly  I have a little thing to finish here while you are away    The great brute bowed its head  turned  and galloped away    Now   said she   we have no table let me see  We had better put it against the trunk of a tree    Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet  Then the Dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast  He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle  Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white  Because they were so very white he could not see much else  it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees    Prepare the victim   said the Witch  And the Dwarf undid Edmund s collar and folded back his shirt at the neck  Then he took Edmund s hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin  After that Edmund heard a strange noise whizz whizz whizz  For a moment he couldn t think what it was  Then he realised  It was the sound of a knife being sharpened   At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction a drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings a scream from the Witch confusion all round him  And then he found he was being untied  Strong arms were round him and he heard big  kind voices saying things like  Let him lie down give him some wine drink this steady now you ll be all right in a minute    Then he heard the voices of people who were talking not to him but to one another  And they were saying things like  Who s got the Witch  I thought you had her I didn t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand I was after the Dwarf Do you mean to say she s escaped  A chap can t mind everything at once What s that  Oh sorry it s only an old stump   But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint   Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds  they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter  all set off to go back to the Stone Table  carrying Edmund with them  But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone  I think they might have been surprised   It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright  if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree stump and on a fair sized boulder  But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder  And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground  And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump  for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the Dwarf  For it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they weren t  and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand  She had kept hold of her wand also  so it had been kept safe  too   When the other children woke up next morning  they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the pavilion  the first thing they heard from Mrs  Beaver was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night  and was at that moment with Aslan  As soon as they had breakfasted they all went out  and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass  apart from the rest of the court  There is no need to tell you  and no one ever heard  what Aslan was saying but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot  As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them bringing Edmund with him    Here is your brother   he said   and there is no need to talk to him about what is past    Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn   I m sorry   and everyone said  That s all right   And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friends with him again something ordinary and natural and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say  But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said    Sire  there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience     Let him approach   said Aslan   The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch s Dwarf    What is your message  Son of Earth   asked Aslan    The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you   said the Dwarf   on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers     Queen of Narnia  indeed   said Mr  Beaver   Of all the cheek     Peace  Beaver   said Aslan   All names will soon be restored to their proper owners  In the meantime we will not dispute about noises  Tell your mistress  Son of Earth  that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak    This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the Dwarf to see that the conditions were properly carried out   But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone   whispered Lucy to Peter  I think the same idea had occurred to the leopards themselves  at any rate  as they walked off their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling like a cat s when it sees a strange dog    It ll be all right   whispered Peter in reply   He wouldn t send them if it weren t    A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan  The three children  who had not seen her before  felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face  and there were low growls among all the animals present  Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold  The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself  It was the oddest thing to see those two faces the golden face and the dead white face so close together  Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes  Mrs  Beaver particularly noticed this    You have a traitor there  Aslan   said the Witch  Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund  But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he d been through and after the talk he d had that morning  He just went on looking at Aslan  It didn t seem to matter what the Witch said    Well   said Aslan   His offence was not against you     Have you forgotten the Deep Magic   asked the Witch    Let us say I have forgotten it   answered Aslan gravely   Tell us of this Deep Magic     Tell you   said the Witch  her voice growing suddenly shriller   Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us  Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree  Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor Beyond the Sea  You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning  You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill     Oh   said Mr  Beaver   So that s how you came to imagine yourself a Queen because you were the Emperor s hangman  I see     Peace  Beaver   said Aslan  with a very low growl    And so   continued the Witch   that human creature is mine  His life is forfeit to me  His blood is my property     Come and take it then   said the Bull with the man s head in a great bellowing voice    Fool   said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl   do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force  He knows the Deep Magic better than that  He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water     It is very true   said Aslan   I do not deny it     Oh  Aslan   whispered Susan in the Lion s ear   can t we I mean  you won t  will you  Can t we do something about the Deep Magic  Isn t there something you can work against it     Work against the Emperor s magic   said Aslan turning to her with something like a frown on his face  And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again   Edmund was on the other side of Aslan  looking all the time at Aslan s face  He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something  but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to wait  and do what he was told    Fall back  all of you   said Aslan   and I will talk to the Witch alone    They all obeyed  It was a terrible time this waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices  Lucy said   Oh  Edmund   and began to cry  Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea  The Beavers stood holding each other s paws with their heads bowed  The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs  But everyone became perfectly still in the end  so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble bee flying past  or the birds in the forest down below them  or the wind rustling the leaves  And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on   At last they heard Aslan s voice   You can all come back   he said   I have settled the matter  She has renounced the claim on your brother s blood   And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding his breath and had now begun breathing again  and then a murmur of talk  They began to come back to Aslan s throne   The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said    But how do I know this promise will be kept     Wow   roared Aslan half rising from his throne  and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder  and the Witch  after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart  picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life       CHAPTER XIV  The Triumph of the Witch  As soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said   We must move from this place at once  it will be wanted for other purposes  We shall encamp to night at the Fords of Beruna    Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the Witch  but his face was stern and everyone s ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared   After a meal  which was taken in the open air on the hill top  for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass  they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up  Before two o clock they were on the march and set off in a North Westerly direction  walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go   During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign   As soon as she has finished her business in these parts   he said   the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege  You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it   He then went on to outline two plans of battle one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle  And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the operations  saying things like   You must put your centaurs in such and such a place  or  You must post scouts to see that she doesn t do so and so   till at last Peter said    But you will be there yourself  Aslan     I can give you no promise of that   answered the Lion  And he continued giving Peter his instructions   For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him  He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad   It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow  This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water  But Peter said    Wouldn t it be better to camp on the far side for fear she should try a night attack or anything    Aslan who seemed to have been thinking about something else roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said   Eh  What s that   Peter said it all over again    No   said Aslan in a dull voice  as if it didn t matter   No  She will not make an attack to night   And then he sighed deeply  But presently he added   All the same it was well thought of  That is how a soldier ought to think  But it doesn t really matter   So they proceeded to pitch their camp   Aslan s mood affected everyone that evening  Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own  the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him  Supper that evening was a quiet meal  Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning  It was as if the good times  having just begun  were already drawing to their end   This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn t get to sleep when she went to bed  And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness    Can t you get to sleep either   said Susan    No   said Lucy   I thought you were asleep  I say  Susan     What     I ve a most horrible feeling as if something were hanging over us     Have you  Because  as a matter of fact  so have I     Something about Aslan   said Lucy   Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him  or something dreadful that he s going to do     There s been something wrong with him all afternoon   said Susan   Lucy  What was that he said about not being with us at the battle  You don t think he could be stealing away and leaving us to night  do you     Where is he now   said Lucy   Is he here in the pavilion     I don t think so     Susan  Let s go outside and have a look round  We might see him     All right  Let s   said Susan   we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here    Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of the tent  The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones  Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy s arm and said   Look   On the far side of the camping ground  just where the trees began  they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood  Without a word they both followed him   He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the left apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table  On and on he led them  into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight  getting their feet wet with the heavy dew  He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew  His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very  very tired  Then  when they were crossing a wide open place where there were no shadows for them to hide in  he stopped and looked round  It was no good trying to run away so they came towards him  When they were closer he said    Oh  children  children  why are you following me     We couldn t sleep   said Lucy and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking    Please  may we come with you wherever you re going   said Susan    Well   said Aslan and seemed to be thinking  Then he said   I should be glad of company to night  Yes  you may come  if you will promise to stop when I tell you  and after that leave me to go on alone     Oh  thank you  thank you  And we will   said the two girls   Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion  But how slowly he walked  And his great  royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass  Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan    Aslan  Dear Aslan   said Lucy   what is wrong  Can t you tell us     Are you ill  dear Aslan   asked Susan    No   said Aslan   I am sad and lonely  Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that    And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his permission but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and  so doing  walked with him  And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood  They went up at the side where the trees came furthest up  and when they got to the last tree  it was one that had some bushes about it  Aslan stopped and said    Oh  children  children  Here you must stop  And whatever happens  do not let yourselves be seen  Farewell    And both the girls cried bitterly  though they hardly knew why  and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great  sad eyes  Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill  And Lucy and Susan  crouching in the bushes  looked after him and this is what they saw   A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned with evil looking red flames and black smoke  But such people  Ogres with monstrous teeth  and wolves  and bull headed men  spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants  and other creatures whom I won t describe because if I did the grown ups would probably not let you read this book Cruels and Hags and Incubuses  Wraiths  Horrors  Efreets  Sprites  Orknies  Wooses  and Ettins  In fact here were all those who were on the Witch s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command  And right in the middle  standing by the Table  was the Witch herself   A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they first saw the great Lion pacing towards them  and for a moment the Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear  Then she recovered herself and gave a wild  fierce laugh    The fool   she cried   The fool has come  Bind him fast    Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan s roar and his spring upon his enemies  But it never came  Four hags  grinning and leering  yet also  at first  hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do  had approached him   Bind him  I say   repeated the White Witch  The hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all  Then others evil dwarfs and apes rushed in to help them and between them they rolled the huge Lion round on his back and tied all his four paws together  shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave  though  had the Lion chosen  one of those paws could have been the death of them all  But he made no noise  even when the enemies  straining and tugging  pulled the cords so tight that they cut into his flesh  Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table    Stop   said the Witch   Let him first be shaved    Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan s head  Snip snip snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground  Then the ogre stood back and the children  watching from their hiding place  could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane  The enemies also saw the difference    Why  he s only a great cat after all   cried one    Is that what we were afraid of   said another   And they surged round Aslan jeering at him  saying things like  Puss  Puss  Poor Pussy   and  How many mice have you caught to day  Cat   and  Would you like a saucer of milk  Pussums     Oh how can they   said Lucy  tears streaming down her cheeks   The brutes  the brutes   for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver  and more beautiful  and more patient than ever    Muzzle him   said the Witch  And even now  as they worked about his face putting on the muzzle  one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands  But he never moved  And this seemed to enrage all that rabble  Everyone was at him now  Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage  and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him  hitting him  spitting on him  jeering at him   At last the rabble had had enough of this  They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table  some pulling and some pushing  He was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him onto the surface of it  Then there was more tying and tightening of cords    The cowards  The cowards   sobbed Susan   Are they still afraid of him  even now    When once Aslan had been tied  and tied so that he was really a mass of cords  on the flat stone  a hush fell on the crowd  Four Hags  holding four torches  stood at the corners of the Table  The Witch bared her arms as she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan  Then she began to whet her knife  It looked to the children  when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it  as if the knife were made of stone not of steel and it was of a strange and evil shape   At last she drew near  She stood by Aslan s head  Her face was working and twitching with passion  but his looked up at the sky  still quiet  neither angry nor afraid  but a little sad  Then  just before she gave the blow  she stooped down and said in a quivering voice    And now  who has won  Fool  did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor  Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased  But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well  And who will take him out of my hand then  Understand that you have given me Narnia forever  you have lost your own life and you have not saved his  In that knowledge  despair and die    The children did not see the actual moment of the killing  They couldn t bear to look and had covered their eyes       CHAPTER XV  Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time  While the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces  they heard the voice of the Witch calling out    Now  Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war  It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool  the great Cat  lies dead    At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger  For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing  the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill top and down the slope right past their hiding place  They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs  and overhead there went a flurry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats  At any other time they would have trembled with fear  but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan s death so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it   As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out into the open hill top  The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her  but still they could see the shape of the great Lion lying dead in his bonds  And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur what was left of it and cried till they could cry no more  And then they looked at each other and held each other s hands for mere loneliness and cried again  and then again were silent  At last Lucy said    I can t bear the look of that horrible muzzle  I wonder could we take it off    So they tried  And after a lot of working at it  for their fingers were cold and it was now the darkest part of the night  they succeeded  And when they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could  And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe    I wonder could we untie him as well   said Susan presently  But the enemies  out of pure spitefulness had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of the knots   I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night  but if you have been if you ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness  You feel as if nothing was ever going to happen again  At any rate that was how it felt to these two  Hours and hours seemed to go by in this dead calm  and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder  But at last Lucy noticed two other things  One was that the sky on the East side of the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago  The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her feet  At first she took no interest in this  What did it matter  Nothing mattered now  But at last she saw that whatever it was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table  And now whatever they were were moving about on Aslan s body  She peered closer  They were little grey things    Ugh   said Susan from the other side of the Table   How beastly  There are horrid little mice crawling over him  Go away  you little beasts   And she raised her hand to frighten them away    Wait   said Lucy who had been looking at them more closely still   Can you see what they re doing    Both girls bent down and stared    I do believe   said Susan   But how queer  They re nibbling away at the cords     That s what I thought   said Lucy   I think they re friendly mice  Poor little things they don t realise he s dead  They think it ll do some good untying him    It was quite definitely lighter by now  Each of the girls noticed for the first time the white face of the other  They could see the mice nibbling away  dozens and dozens  even hundreds  of little field mice  And at last  one by one  the ropes were all gnawed through   The sky in the East was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter all except one very big one low down on the Eastern horizon  They felt colder than they had been all night  The mice crept away again   The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes  Aslan looked more like himself without them  Every moment his dead face looked nobler  as the light grew and they could see it better   In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound  It had been so still for hours and hours that it startled them  Then another bird answered it  Soon there were birds singing all over the place   It was quite definitely early morning now  not late night    I m so cold   said Lucy    So am I   said Susan   Let s walk about a bit    They walked to the Eastern edge of the hill and looked down  The one big star had almost disappeared  The country all looked dark grey  but beyond  at the very end of the world  the sea showed pale  The sky began to turn red  They walked to and fro more times than they could count between the dead Aslan and the Eastern ridge  trying to keep warm  and oh  how tired their legs felt  Then at last  as they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel  which they could now just make out  the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun  At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise a great cracking  deafening noise as if a giant had broken a giant s plate    What s that   said Lucy  clutching Susan s arm    I I feel afraid to turn round   said Susan   something awful is happening     They re doing something worse to him   said Lucy   Come on   And she turned  pulling Susan round with her   The rising of the sun had made everything look so different all the colours and shadows were changed that for a moment they didn t see the important thing  Then they did  The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end  and there was no Aslan    Oh  oh  oh   cried the two girls rushing back to the Table    Oh  it s too bad   sobbed Lucy   they might have left the body alone     Who s done it   cried Susan   What does it mean  Is it more magic     Yes   said a great voice behind their backs   It is more magic   They looked round  There  shining in the sunrise  larger than they had seen him before  shaking his mane  for it had apparently grown again  stood Aslan himself    Oh  Aslan   cried both the children  staring up at him  almost as much frightened as they were glad    Aren t you dead then  dear Aslan   said Lucy    Not now   said Aslan    You re not not a    asked Susan in a shaky voice  She couldn t bring herself to say the word ghost   Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead  The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her    Do I look it   he said    Oh  you re real  you re real  Oh  Aslan   cried Lucy and both girls flung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses    But what does it all mean   asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer    It means   said Aslan   that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic  there is a magic deeper still which she did not know  Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time  But if she could have looked a little further back  into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned  she would have read there a different incantation  She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor s stead  the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards  And now    Oh yes  Now   said Lucy jumping up and clapping her hands    Oh  children   said the Lion   I feel my strength coming back to me  Oh  children  catch me if you can   He stood for a second  his eyes very bright  his limbs quivering  lashing himself with his tail  Then he made a leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table  Laughing  though she didn t know why  Lucy scrambled over it to reach him  Aslan leaped again  A mad chase began  Round and round the hill top he led them  now hopelessly out of their reach  now letting them almost catch his tail  now diving between them  now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again  and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs  It was such a romp as no one has ever had except in Narnia  and whether it was more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind  And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty    And now   said Aslan presently   to business  I feel I am going to roar  You had better put your fingers in your ears    And they did  And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it  And they saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind  Then he said    We have a long journey to go  You must ride on me   And he crouched down and the children climbed onto his warm  golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan  And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off  faster than any horse could go  downhill and into the thick of the forest   That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia  Have you ever had a gallop on a horse  Think of that  and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the harness and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws  Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur  and the mane flying back in the wind  And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse  But this is a mount that doesn t need to be guided and never grows tired  He rushes on and on  never missing his footing  never hesitating  threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunks  jumping over bush and briar and the smaller streams  wading the larger  swimming the largest of all  And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs but right across Narnia  in spring  down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak  through wild orchards of snow white cherry trees  past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns  up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down  down  down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers   It was nearly mid day when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle a little toy castle it looked from where they stood which seemed to be all pointed towers  But the Lion was rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it  And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them  No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut  And Aslan  not at all slacking his pace  rushed straight as a bullet towards it    The Witch s home   he cried   Now  children  hold tight    Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down  and the children felt as if they had left their insides behind them  for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped or you may call it flying rather than jumping right over the castle wall  The two girls  breathless but unhurt  found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues       CHAPTER XVI  What Happened about the Statues   What an extraordinary place   cried Lucy   All those stone animals and people too  It s it s like a museum     Hush   said Susan   Aslan s doing something    He was indeed  He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him  Then without waiting a moment he whisked round almost as if he had been a cat chasing its tail and breathed also on the stone dwarf  which  as you remember  was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it  Then he pounced on a tall stone Dryad which stood beyond the dwarf  turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right  and rushed on to two centaurs  But at that moment Lucy said    Oh  Susan  Look  Look at the lion    I expect you ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire  And for a second nothing seems to have happened  and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper  It was like that now  For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same  Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back then it spread then the colour seemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all over a bit of paper then  while his hind quarters were still obviously stone the lion shook his mane and all the heavy  stony folds rippled into living hair  Then he opened a great red mouth  warm and living  and gave a prodigious yawn  And now his hind legs had come to life  He lifted one of them and scratched himself  Then  having caught sight of Aslan  he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face   Of course the children s eyes turned to follow the lion  but the sight they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him  Everywhere the statues were coming to life  The courtyard looked no longer like a museum  it looked more like a zoo  Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd  Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard was now a blaze of colours  glossy chestnut sides of centaurs  indigo horns of unicorns  dazzling plumage of birds  reddy brown of foxes  dogs  and satyrs  yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs  and the birch girls in silver  and the beech girls in fresh  transparent green  and the larch girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow  And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings  brayings  yelpings  barkings  squealings  cooings  neighings  stampings  shouts  hurrahs  songs and laughter    Ooh   said Susan in a different tone   Look  I wonder I mean  is it safe    Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant    It s all right   shouted Aslan joyously   Once the feet are put right  all the rest of him will follow     That wasn t exactly what I meant   whispered Susan to Lucy  But it was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her  The change was already creeping up the Giant s legs  Now he was moving his feet  A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder  rubbed his eyes and said    Bless me  I must have been asleep  Now  Where s that dratted little Witch that was running about on the ground  Somewhere just by my feet it was   But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened  and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood  then he bowed down till his head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan  beaming all over his honest ugly face   giants of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming  It s a sight well worth looking at     Now for the inside of this house   said Aslan   Look alive  everyone  Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady s chamber  Leave no corner unsearched  You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed    And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of that dark  horrible  fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows and with everyone s voices crying out at once  Don t forget the dungeons Give us a hand with this door  Here s another little winding stair Oh  I say  Here s a poor little kangaroo  Call Aslan Phew  How it smells in here Look out for trap doors Up here  There are a whole lot more on the landing   But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out    Aslan  Aslan  I ve found Mr  Tumnus  Oh  do come quick    A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding one another by both hands and dancing round and round for joy  The little chap was none the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all she had to tell him   But at last the ransacking of the Witch s fortress was ended  The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil places which needed them so badly  The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the courtyard  And it was then that someone  Tumnus  I think  first said    But how are we going to get out   for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gates were still locked    That ll be all right   said Aslan  and then  rising on his hind legs  he bawled up at the Giant   Hi  You up there   he roared   What s your name     Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour   said the Giant  once more touching his cap    Well then  Giant Rumblebuffin   said Aslan   just let us out of this  will you     Certainly  your honour  It will be a pleasure   said Giant Rumblebuffin   Stand well away from the gates  all you little  uns   Then he strode to the gate himself and bang bang bang went his huge club  The gates creaked at the first blow  cracked at the second  and shivered at the third  Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble  and when the dust cleared it was odd  standing in that dry  grim  stony yard  to see through the gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest  and the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky    Blowed if I ain t all in a muck sweat   said the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine   Comes of being out of condition  I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket handkerchee about you     Yes  I have   said Lucy standing on tip toes and holding her handkerchief up as far as she could reach    Thank you  Missie   said Giant Rumblebuffin stooping down  Next moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid air between the Giant s finger and thumb  But just as she was getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering   Bless me  I ve picked up the little girl instead  I beg your pardon  Missie  I thought you was the handkerchee     No  no   said Lucy laughing   here it is   This time he managed to get it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you  so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face  she said   I m afraid it s not much use to you  Mr  Rumblebuffin     Not at all  Not at all   said the Giant politely   Never met a nicer handkerchee  So fine  so handy  So I don t know how to describe it     What a nice giant he is   said Lucy to Mr  Tumnus    Oh yes   replied the Faun   All the Buffins always were  One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia  Not very clever  perhaps  I never knew a giant that was  but an old family  With traditions  you know  If he d been the other sort she d never have turned him into stone    At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence    Our day s work is not yet over   he said   and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed time we must find the battle at once     And join in I hope  Sir   added the largest of the centaurs    Of course   said Aslan   And now  Those who can t keep up that is  children  dwarfs  and small animals must ride on the backs of those who can that is  lions  centaurs  unicorns  horses  giants and eagles  Those who are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out where the battle is  Look lively and sort yourselves    And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did  The most pleased of the lot was the other lion  who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met   Did you hear what he said  Us lions  That means him and me  Us lions  That s what I like about Aslan  No side  no stand off ishness  Us lions  That meant him and me   At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs  one Dryad  two rabbits  and a hedgehog  That steadied him a bit   When all were ready  it was a big sheep dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order  they set out through the gap in the castle wall  At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all directions  But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay  There was no time lost after that  Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses to the ground  and all the others  streaked out for about half a mile behind them  were following as fast as they could  The noise was like an English fox hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself  Faster and faster they went as the scent became easier and easier to follow  And then  just as they came to the last curve in a narrow  winding valley  Lucy heard above all these noises another noise a different one  which gave her a queer feeling inside  It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal   Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason  There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan s army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night  only now  in the daylight  they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed  There also seemed to be far more of them  Aslan s army which had their backs to her looked terribly few  And there were statues dotted all over the battlefield  so apparently the Witch had been using her wand  But she did not seem to be using it now  She was fighting with her stone knife  It was Peter she was fighting both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening  she only saw the stone knife and Peter s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knives and three swords  That pair were in the centre  On each side the line stretched out  Horrible things were happening wherever she looked    Off my back  children   shouted Aslan  And they both tumbled off  Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the Western lamp post to the shores of the Eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch  Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement  Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath  and at the same moment all war like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch s house rushed madly on the enemy s line  dwarfs with their battle axes  dogs with teeth  the giant with his club  and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe  unicorns with their horns  centaurs with swords and hoofs  And Peter s tired army cheered  and the newcomers roared  and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re echoed with the din of that onset       CHAPTER XVII  The Hunting of the White Stag  The battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival  Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his companions  and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight  The next thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands  It was strange to her to see Peter looking as he looked now his face was so pale and stern and he seemed so much older    It was all Edmund s doing  Aslan   Peter was saying   We d have been beaten if it hadn t been for him  The Witch was turning our troops into stone right and left  But nothing would stop him  He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue  And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains  That was the mistake all the rest were making  Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance if we hadn t lost so many already  He was terribly wounded  We must go and see him    They found Edmund in charge of Mrs  Beaver a little way back from the fighting line  He was covered with blood  his mouth was open  and his face a nasty green colour    Quick  Lucy   said Aslan   And then  almost for the first time  Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present  Her hands trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper  but she managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her brother s mouth    There are other people wounded   said Aslan while she was still looking eagerly into Edmund s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result    Yes  I know   said Lucy crossly   Wait a minute     Daughter of Eve   said Aslan in a graver voice   others also are at the point of death  Must more people die for Edmund     I m sorry  Aslan   said Lucy getting up and going with him  And for the next half hour they were busy she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone  When at last she was free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look oh  for ages  in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong  He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face  And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a Knight    Does he know   whispered Lucy to Susan   what Aslan did for him  Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was     Hush  No  Of course not   said Susan    Oughtn t he to be told   said Lucy    Oh  surely not   said Susan   It would be too awful for him  Think how you d feel if you were he     All the same I think he ought to know   said Lucy  But at that moment they were interrupted   That night they slept where they were  How Aslan provided food for them all I don t know  but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o clock  Next day they began marching Eastward down the side of the great river  And the next day after that  at about tea time  they actually reached the mouth  The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them  before them were the sands  with rocks and little pools of salt water  and sea weed  and the smell of the sea  and long miles of bluish green waves breaking forever and ever on the beach  And  oh  the cry of the sea gulls  Have you heard it  Can you remember   That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes  But next day was more solemn  For then  in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west door all hung with peacock s feathers and the eastern door which opens right onto the sea  in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets  Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them onto the four thrones amid deafening shouts of   Long Live King Peter  Long Live Queen Susan  Long Live King Edmund  Long Live Queen Lucy     Once a king or queen in Narnia  always a king or queen  Bear it well  Sons of Adam  Bear it well  Daughters of Eve   said Aslan   And through the Eastern door  which was wide open came the voices of the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the castle steps and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens   So the children sat in their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands and they gave rewards and honours to all their friends  to Tumnus the Faun  and to the Beavers  and Giant Rumblebuffin  to the leopards  and the good centaurs and the good dwarfs  and to the lion  And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel  and revelry and dancing  and gold flashed and wine flowed  and answering to the music inside  but stranger  sweeter  and more piercing  came the music of the sea people   But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away  And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn t there they said nothing about it  For Mr  Beaver had warned them   He ll be coming and going  he had said   One day you ll see him and another you won t  He doesn t like being tied down and of course he has other countries to attend to  It s quite all right  He ll often drop in  Only you mustn t press him  He s wild  you know  Not like a tame lion    And now  as you see  this story is nearly  but not quite  at an end  These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well and long and happy was their reign  At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch s army and destroying them  and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest a haunting here and a killing there  a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next  But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out  And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cut down  and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school  and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live  And they drove back the fierce giants  quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin  on the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier  And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from them  And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them  And Peter became a tall and deep chested man and a great warrior  and he was called King Peter the Magnificent  And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the Kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage  And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle  Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter  and great in council and judgement  He was called King Edmund the Just  But as for Lucy  she was always gay and golden haired  and all Princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen  and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant   So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was only as one remembers a dream  And one year it fell out that Tumnus  who was a middle aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout  came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his parts the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him  So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court  rode a hunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag  And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him  And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin  till the horses of all the courtiers were tired out and only these four were still following  And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow  Then said King Peter  for they talked in quite a different style now  having been Kings and Queens for so long   Fair Consorts  let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket  for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry     Sir   said the others   even so let us do    So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot  And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said    Fair friends  here is a great marvel  for I seem to see a tree of iron     Madam   said King Edmund   if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof     Marry  a strange device   said King Peter   to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man     Sir   said Queen Lucy   By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller trees in the place  or fewer  or none  For this is a young wood and the iron post is old   And they stood looking upon it  Then said King Edmund    I know not how it is  but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely  It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before  as it were in a dream  or in the dream of a dream     Sir   answered they all   it is even so with us also     And more   said Queen Lucy   for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern  either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes     Madam   said King Edmund   the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also     And in mine  fair brother   said King Peter    And in mine too   said Queen Susan   Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further     Madam   said King Peter   therein I pray thee to have me excused  For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter  as battles  quests  feats of arms  acts of justice  and the like  and then given over  but always what we have taken in hand  the same we have achieved     Sister   said Queen Lucy   my royal brother speaks rightly  And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase     And so say I   said King Edmund   And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands     Then in the name of Aslan   said Queen Susan   if ye will all have it so  let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us    So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket  and before they had gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamp post  and before they had gone twenty more  they noticed that they were making their way not through branches but through coats  And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room  and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter  Susan  Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes  It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide  Mrs  Macready and the visitors were still talking in the passage  but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the children weren t caught   And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe were missing  And the Professor  who was a very remarkable man  didn t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies  but believed the whole story   No   he said   I don t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats  You won t get into Narnia again by that route  Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did  Eh  What s that  Yes  of course you ll get back to Narnia again some day  Once a King in Narnia  always a King in Narnia  But don t go trying to use the same route twice  Indeed  don t try to get there at all  It ll happen when you re not looking for it  And don t talk too much about it even among yourselves  And don t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they ve had adventures of the same sort themselves  What s that  How will you know  Oh  you ll know all right  Odd things  they say even their looks will let the secret out  Keep your eyes open  Bless me  what do they teach them at these schools    And that is the very end of the adventures of the wardrobe  But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia       The End       '"

       "'CHAPTER I Lucy Looks into a Wardrobe Once there were four child whose name were Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air raid They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country ten mile from the nearest railway station and two mile from the nearest post office He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three servant Their name were Ivy Margaret and Betty but they do not come into the story much He himself wa a very old man with shaggy white hair which grew over most of his face a well a on his head and they liked him almost at once but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he wa so odd looking that Lucy who wa the youngest wa a little afraid of him and Edmund who wa the next youngest wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he wa blowing his nose to hide it As soon a they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night the boy came into the girl room and they all talked it over We ve fallen on our foot and no mistake said Peter This is going to be perfectly splendid That old chap will let u do anything we like I think he s an old dear said Susan Oh come off it said Edmund who wa tired and pretending not to be tired which always made him bad tempered Don t go on talking like that Like what said Susan and anyway it s time you were in bed Trying to talk like Mother said Edmund And who are you to say when I m to go to bed Go to bed yourself Hadn t we all better go to bed said Lucy There s sure to be a row if we re heard talking here No there won t said Peter I tell you this is the sort of house where no one s going to mind what we do Anyway they won t hear u It s about ten minute walk from here down to that dining room and any amount of stair and passage in between What s that noise said Lucy suddenly It wa a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passage and row of door leading into empty room wa beginning to make her feel a little creepy It s only a bird silly said Edmund It s an owl said Peter This is going to be a wonderful place for bird I shall go to bed now I say let s go and explore to morrow You might find anything in a place like this Did you see those mountain a we came along And the wood There might be eagle There might be stag There ll be hawk Badgers said Lucy Snakes said Edmund Foxes said Susan But when next morning came there wa a steady rain falling so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountain nor the wood nor even the stream in the garden Of course it would be raining said Edmund They had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them a long low room with two window looking out in one direction and two in another Do stop grumbling Ed said Susan Ten to one it ll clear up in an hour or so And in the meantime we re pretty well off There s a wireless and lot of book Not for me said Peter I m going to explore in the house Everyone agreed to this and that wa how the adventure began It wa the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of and it wa full of unexpected place The first few door they tried led only into spare bedroom a everyone had expected that they would but soon they came to a very long room full of picture and there they found a suit of armour and after that wa a room all hung with green with a harp in one corner and then came three step down and five step up and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony and then a whole series of room that led into each other and were lined with book most of them very old book and some bigger than a Bible in a church And shortly after that they looked into a room that wa quite empty except for one big wardrobe the sort that ha a looking glass in the door There wa nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue bottle on the window sill Nothing there said Peter and they all trooped out again all except Lucy She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked To her surprise it opened quite easily and two moth ball dropped out Looking into the inside she saw several coat hanging up mostly long fur coat There wa nothing Lucy liked so much a the smell and feel of fur She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coat and rubbed her face against them leaving the door open of course because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe Soon she went further in and found that there wa a second row of coat hanging up behind the first one It wa almost quite dark in there and she kept her arm stretched out in front of her so a not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe She took a step further in then two or three step always expecting to feel woodwork against the tip of her finger But she could not feel it This must be a simply enormous wardrobe thought Lucy going still further in and pushing the soft fold of the coat aside to make room for her Then she noticed that there wa something crunching under her foot I wonder is that more moth ball she thought stooping down to feel it with her hand But instead of feeling the hard smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold This is very queer she said and went on a step or two further Next moment she found that what wa rubbing against her face and hand wa no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly Why it is just like branch of tree exclaimed Lucy And then she saw that there wa a light ahead of her not a few inch away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been but a long way off Something cold and soft wa falling on her A moment later she found that she wa standing in the middle of a wood at night time with snow under her foot and snowflake falling through the air Lucy felt a little frightened but she felt very inquisitive and excited a well She looked back over her shoulder and there between the dark tree trunk she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out She had of course left the door open for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe It seemed to be still daylight there I can always get back if anything go wrong thought Lucy She began to walk forward crunch crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light In about ten minute she reached it and found that it wa a lamp post As she stood looking at it wondering why there wa a lamp post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next she heard a pitter patter of foot coming towards her And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the tree into the light of the lamp post He wa only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella white with snow From the waist upwards he wa like a man but his leg were shaped like a goat s the hair on them wa glossy black and instead of foot he had goat s hoof He also had a tail but Lucy did not notice this at first because it wa neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so a to keep it from trailing in the snow He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin wa rather reddish too He had a strange but pleasant little face with a short pointed beard and curly hair and out of the hair there stuck two horn one on each side of his forehead One of his hand a I have said held the umbrella in the other arm he carried several brown paper parcel What with the parcel and the snow it looked just a if he had been doing his Christmas shopping He wa a Faun And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcel Goodness gracious me exclaimed the Faun CHAPTER II What Lucy Found There Good evening said Lucy But the Faun wa so busy picking up his parcel that at first he did not reply When he had finished he made her a little bow Good evening good evening said the Faun Excuse me I don t want to be inquisitive but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve My name s Lucy said she not quite understanding him But you are forgive me you are what they call a girl asked the Faun Of course I m a girl said Lucy You are in fact Human Of course I m human said Lucy still a little puzzled To be sure to be sure said the Faun How stupid of me But I ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before I am delighted That is to say and then he stopped a if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time Delighted delighted he went on Allow me to introduce myself My name is Tumnus I am very pleased to meet you Mr Tumnus said Lucy And may I ask O Lucy Daughter of Eve said Mr Tumnus how you have come into Narnia Narnia What s that said Lucy This is the land of Narnia said the Faun where we are now all that lie between the lamp post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea And you you have come from the wild wood of the west I I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room said Lucy Ah said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice if only I had worked harder at geography when I wa a little Faun I should no doubt know all about those strange country It is too late now But they aren t country at all said Lucy almost laughing It s only just back there at least I m not sure It is summer there Meanwhile said Mr Tumnus it is winter in Narnia and ha been for ever so long and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reign around the bright city of War Drobe how would it be if you came and had tea with me Thank you very much Mr Tumnus said Lucy But I wa wondering whether I ought to be getting back It s only just round the corner said the Faun and there ll be a roaring fire and toast and sardine and cake Well it s very kind of you said Lucy But I shan t be able to stay long If you will take my arm Daughter of Eve said Mr Tumnus I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of u That s the way Now off we go And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature a if they had known one another all their life They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rock all about and little hill up and little hill down At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenly aside a if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock but at the last moment Lucy found he wa leading her into the entrance of a cave As soon a they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs and lit a lamp Now we shan t be long he said and immediately put a kettle on Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place It wa a little dry clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chair one for me and one for a friend said Mr Tumnus and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard In one corner there wa a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus bedroom and on one wall wa a shelf full of book Lucy looked at these while he wa setting out the tea thing They had title like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men Monks and Gamekeepers a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth Now Daughter of Eve said the Faun And really it wa a wonderful tea There wa a nice brown egg lightly boiled for each of them and then sardine on toast and then buttered toast and then toast with honey and then a sugar topped cake And when Lucy wa tired of eating the Faun began to talk He had wonderful tale to tell of life in the forest He told about the midnight dance and how the Nymphs who lived in the well and the Dryads who lived in the tree came out to dance with the Fauns about long hunting party after the milk white Stag who could give you wish if you caught him about feasting and treasure seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mine and cavern far beneath the forest floor and then about summer when the wood were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them and sometimes Bacchus himself and then the stream would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for week on end Not that it isn t always winter now he added gloomily Then to cheer himself up he took out from it case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked a if it were made of straw and began to play And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time It must have been hour later when she shook herself and said Oh Mr Tumnus I m so sorry to stop you and I do love that tune but really I must go home I only meant to stay for a few minute It s no good now you know said the Faun laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully No good said Lucy jumping up and feeling rather frightened What do you mean I ve got to go home at once The others will be wondering what ha happened to me But a moment later she asked Mr Tumnus Whatever is the matter for the Faun s brown eye had filled with tear and then the tear began trickling down his cheek and soon they were running off the end of his nose and at last he covered his face with his hand and began to howl Mr Tumnus Mr Tumnus said Lucy in great distress Don t Don t What is the matter Aren t you well Dear Mr Tumnus do tell me what is wrong But the Faun continued sobbing a if his heart would break And even when Lucy went over and put her arm round him and lent him her handkerchief he did not stop He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it wringing it out with both hand whenever it got too wet to be any more use so that presently Lucy wa standing in a damp patch Mr Tumnus bawled Lucy in his ear shaking him Do stop Stop it at once You ought to be ashamed of yourself a great big Faun like you What on earth are you cry about Oh oh oh sobbed Mr Tumnus I m cry because I m such a bad Faun I don t think you re a bad Faun at all said Lucy I think you are a very good Faun You are the nicest Faun I ve ever met Oh oh you wouldn t say that if you knew replied Mr Tumnus between his sob No I m a bad Faun I don t suppose there ever wa a worse Faun since the beginning of the world But what have you done asked Lucy My old father now said Mr Tumnus that s his picture over the mantelpiece He would never have done a thing like this A thing like what said Lucy Like what I ve done said the Faun Taken service under the White Witch That s what I am I m in the pay of the White Witch The White Witch Who is she Why it is she that ha got all Narnia under her thumb It s she that make it always winter Always winter and never Christmas think of that How awful said Lucy But what doe she pay you for That s the worst of it said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan I m a kidnapper for her that s what I am Look at me Daughter of Eve Would you believe that I m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood one that had never done me any harm and pretend to be friendly with it and invite it home to my cave all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch No said Lucy I m sure you wouldn t do anything of the sort But I have said the Faun Well said Lucy rather slowly for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him well that wa pretty bad But you re so sorry for it that I m sure you will never do it again Daughter of Eve don t you understand said the Faun It isn t something I have done I m doing it now this very moment What do you mean cried Lucy turning very white You are the child said Mr Tumnus I had order from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood I wa to catch them and hand them over to her And you are the first I ever met And I ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea and all the time I ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell her Oh but you won t Mr Tumnus said Lucy You won t will you Indeed indeed you really mustn t And if I don t said he beginning to cry again she s sure to find out And she ll have my tail cut off and my horn sawn off and my beard plucked out and she ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoof and turn them into horrid solid hoof like a wretched horse s And if she is extra and specially angry she ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four throne at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness know when that will happen or whether it will ever happen at all I m very sorry Mr Tumnus said Lucy But please let me go home Of course I will said the Faun Of course I ve got to I see that now I hadn t known what Humans were like before I met you Of course I can t give you up to the Witch not now that I know you But we must be off at once I ll see you back to the lamp post I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe I m sure I can said Lucy We must go a quietly a we can said Mr Tumnus The whole wood is full of her spy Even some of the tree are on her side They both got up and left the tea thing on the table and Mr Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm and they went out into the snow The journey back wa not at all like the journey to the Faun s cave they stole along a quickly a they could without speaking a word and Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest place Lucy wa relieved when they reached the lamp post again Do you know your way from here Daughter of Eve said Tumnus Lucy looked very hard between the tree and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight Yes she said I can see the wardrobe door Then be off home a quick a you can said the Faun and c can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do Why of course I can said Lucy shaking him heartily by the hand And I do hope you won t get into dreadful trouble on my account Farewell Daughter of Eve said he Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief Rather said Lucy and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight a quickly a her leg would carry her And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her she felt coat and instead of crunching snow under her foot she felt wooden board and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around panting for breath It wa still raining and she could hear the voice of the others in the passage I m here she shouted I m here I ve come back I m all right CHAPTER III Edmund and the Wardrobe Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three It s all right she repeated I ve come back What on earth are you talking about Lucy asked Susan Why said Lucy in amazement haven t you all been wondering where I wa So you ve been hiding have you said Peter Poor old Lu hiding and nobody noticed You ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you But I ve been away for hour and hour said Lucy The others all stared at one another Batty said Edmund tapping his head Quite batty What do you mean Lu asked Peter What I said answered Lucy It wa just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe and I ve been away for hour and hour and had tea and all sort of thing have happened Don t be silly Lucy said Susan We ve only just come out of that room a moment ago and you were there then She s not being silly at all said Peter she s just making up a story for fun aren t you Lu And why shouldn t she No Peter I m not she said It s it s a magic wardrobe There s a wood inside it and it s snowing and there s a Faun and a witch and it s called Narnia come and see The others did not know what to think but Lucy wa so excited that they all went back with her into the room She rushed ahead of them flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried Now go in and see for yourselves Why you goose said Susan putting her head inside and pulling the fur coat apart it s just an ordinary wardrobe look there s the back of it Then everyone looked in and pulled the coat apart and they all saw Lucy herself saw a perfectly ordinary wardrobe There wa no wood and no snow only the back of the wardrobe with hook on it Peter went in and rapped his knuckle on it to make sure that it wa solid A jolly good hoax Lu he said a he came out again you have really taken u in I must admit We half believed you But it wasn t a hoax at all said Lucy really and truly It wa all different a moment ago Honestly it wa I promise Come Lu said Peter that s going a bit far You ve had your joke Hadn t you better drop it now Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something though she hardly knew what she wa trying to say and burst into tear For the next few day she wa very miserable She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing wa only a story made up for fun But Lucy wa a very truthful girl and she knew that she wa really in the right and she could not bring herself to say this The others who thought she wa telling a lie and a silly lie too made her very unhappy The two elder one did this without meaning to do it but Edmund could be spiteful and on this occasion he wa spiteful He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she d found any other new country in other cupboard all over the house What made it worse wa that these day ought to have been delightful The weather wa fine and they were out of door from morning to night bathing fishing climbing tree bird nesting and lying in the heather But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it And so thing went on until the next wet day That day when it came to the afternoon and there wa still no sign of a break in the weather they decided to play hide and seek Susan wa It and a soon a the others scattered to hide Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe wa She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business But she did want to have one more look inside it for by this time she wa beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream The house wa so large and complicated and full of hiding place that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else But a soon a she reached it she heard step in the passage outside and then there wa nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe even if it is not a magic one Now the step she had heard were those of Edmund and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe He at once decided to get into it himself not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country He opened the door There were the coat hanging up a usual and a smell of mothball and darkness and silence and no sign of Lucy She think I m Susan come to catch her said Edmund to himself and so she s keeping very quiet in at the back He jumped in and shut the door forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark He had expected to find her in a few second and wa very surprised when he did not He decided to open the door again and let in some light But he could not find the door either He didn t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction he even shouted out Lucy Lu Where are you I know you re here There wa no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound not the sound you expect in a cupboard but a kind of open air sound He also noticed that he wa unexpectedly cold and then he saw a light Thank goodness said Edmund the door must have swung open of it own accord He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light which he thought wa the open door of the wardrobe But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir tree into an open place in the middle of a wood There wa crisp dry snow under his foot and more snow lying on the branch of the tree Overhead there wa a pale blue sky the sort of sky one see on a fine winter day in the morning Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree trunk the sun just rising very red and clear Everything wa perfectly still a if he were the only living creature in that country There wa not even a robin or a squirrel among the tree and the wood stretched a far a he could see in every direction He shivered He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her imaginary country which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted Lucy Lucy I m here too Edmund There wa no answer She s angry about all the thing I ve been saying lately thought Edmund And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong he also did not much like being alone in this strange cold quiet place so he shouted again I say Lu I m sorry I didn t believe you I see now you were right all along Do come out Make it Pax Still there wa no answer Just like a girl said Edmund to himself sulking somewhere and won t accept an apology He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place and had almost made up his mind to go home when he heard very far off in the wood a sound of bell He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer The reindeer were about the size of Shetland pony and their hair wa so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them their branching horn were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them Their harness wa of scarlet leather and covered with bell On the sledge driving the reindeer sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three foot high if he had been standing He wa dressed in polar bear s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from it point his huge beard covered his knee and served him instead of a rug But behind him on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person a great lady taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen She also wa covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head Her face wa white not merely pale but white like snow or paper or icing sugar except for her very red mouth It wa a beautiful face in other respect but proud and cold and stern The sledge wa a fine sight a it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bell jingling and the Dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it Stop said the Lady and the Dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bit and blowing In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostril looked like smoke And what pray are you said the Lady looking hard at Edmund I m I m my name s Edmund said Edmund rather awkwardly He did not like the way she looked at him The Lady frowned Is that how you address a Queen she asked looking sterner than ever I beg your pardon your Majesty I didn t know said Edmund Not know the Queen of Narnia cried she Ha You shall know u better hereafter But I repeat what are you Please your Majesty said Edmund I don t know what you mean I m at school at least I wa it s the holiday now CHAPTER IV Turkish Delight But what are you said the Queen again Are you a great overgrown dwarf that ha cut off it beard No your Majesty said Edmund I never had a beard I m a boy A boy said she Do you mean you are a Son of Adam Edmund stood still saying nothing He wa too confused by this time to understand what the question meant I see you are an idiot whatever else you may be said the Queen Answer me once and for all or I shall lose my patience Are you human Yes your Majesty said Edmund And how pray did you come to enter my dominion Please your Majesty I came in through a wardrobe A wardrobe What do you mean I I opened a door and just found myself here your Majesty said Edmund Ha said the Queen speaking more to herself than to him A door A door from the world of men I have heard of such thing This may wreck all But he is only one and he is easily dealt with As she spoke these word she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face her eye flaming at the same moment she raised her wand Edmund felt sure that she wa going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move Then just a he gave himself up for lost she appeared to change her mind My poor child she said in quite a different voice how cold you look Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her foot and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in Perhaps something hot to drink said the Queen Should you like that Yes please your Majesty said Edmund whose teeth were chattering The Queen took from somewhere among her wrapping a very small bottle which looked a if it were made of copper Then holding out her arm she let one drop fall from it on to the snow beside the sledge Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid air shining like a diamond But the moment it touched the snow there wa a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed The Dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile not a very nice smile Edmund felt much better a he began to sip the hot drink It wa something he had never tasted before very sweet and foamy and creamy and it warmed him right down to his toe It is dull Son of Adam to drink without eating said the Queen presently What would you like best to eat Turkish Delight please your Majesty said Edmund The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow and instantly there appeared a round box tied with green silk ribbon which when opened turned out to contain several pound of the best Turkish Delight Each piece wa sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious He wa quite warm now and very comfortable While he wa eating the Queen kept asking him question At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one s mouth full but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down a much Turkish Delight a he could and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sister and that one of his sister had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there and that no one except himself and his brother and his sister knew anything about Narnia She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it You are sure there are just four of you she asked Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve neither more nor le and Edmund with his mouth full of Turkish Delight kept on saying Yes I told you that before and forgetting to call her Your Majesty but she didn t seem to mind now At last the Turkish Delight wa all finished and Edmund wa looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more Probably the Queen knew quite well what he wa thinking for she knew though Edmund did not that this wa enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it and would even if they were allowed go on eating it till they killed themselves But she did not offer him any more Instead she said to him Son of Adam I should so much like to see your brother and your two sister Will you bring them to see me I ll try said Edmund still looking at the empty box Because if you did come again bringing them with you of course I d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight I can t do it now the magic will only work once In my own house it would be another matter Why can t we go to your house now said Edmund When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back but he had forgotten about that fear now It is a lovely place my house said the Queen I am sure you would like it There are whole room full of Turkish Delight and what s more I have no child of my own I want a nice boy whom I could bring up a a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone While he wa Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I ve ever met I think I would like to make you the Prince some day when you bring the others to visit me Why not now said Edmund His face had become very red and his mouth and finger were sticky He did not look either clever or handsome whatever the Queen might say Oh but if I took you there now said she I shouldn t see your brother and your sister I very much want to know your charming relation You are to be the Prince and later on the King that is understood But you must have courtier and noble I will make your brother a Duke and your sister Duchesses There s nothing special about them said Edmund and anyway I could always bring them some other time Ah but once you were in my house said the Queen you might forget all about them You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn t want the bother of going to fetch them No You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day with them you understand It is no good coming without them But I don t even know the way back to my own country pleaded Edmund That s easy answered the Queen Do you see that lamp She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp post under which Lucy had met the Faun Straight on beyond that is the way to the World of Men And now look the other way here she pointed in the opposite direction and tell me if you can see two little hill rising above the tree I think I can said Edmund Well my house is between those two hill So next time you come you have only to find the lamp post and look for those two hill and walk through the wood till you reach my house You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it But remember you must bring the others with you I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone I ll do my best said Edmund And by the way said the Queen you needn t tell them about me It would be fun to keep it a secret between u two wouldn t it Make it a surprise for them Just bring them along to the two hill a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that and when you come to my house you could just say Let s see who life here or something like that I am sure that would be best If your sister ha met one of the Fauns she may have heard strange story about me nasty story that might make her afraid to come to me Fauns will say anything you know and now Please please said Edmund suddenly please couldn t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home No no said the Queen with a laugh you must wait till next time While she spoke she signalled to the Dwarf to drive on but a the sledge swept away out of sight the Queen waved to Edmund calling out Next time Next time Don t forget Come soon Edmund wa still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood Oh Edmund she cried So you ve got in too Isn t it wonderful and now All right said Edmund I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all I ll say I m sorry if you like But where on earth have you been all this time I ve been looking for you everywhere If I d known you had got in I d have waited for you said Lucy who wa too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face wa I ve been having lunch with dear Mr Tumnus the Faun and he s very well and the White Witch ha done nothing to him for letting me go so he think she can t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all The White Witch said Edmund who s she She is a perfectly terrible person said Lucy She call herself the Queen of Narnia though she ha no right to be queen at all and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarf and animal at least all the good one simply hate her And she can turn people into stone and do all kind of horrible thing And she ha made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia always winter but it never get to Christmas And she drive about on a sledge drawn by a reindeer with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head Edmund wa already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweet and when he heard that the Lady he had made friend with wa a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch he asked Mr Tumnus the Faun said Lucy You can t always believe what Fauns say said Edmund trying to sound a if he knew far more about them than Lucy Who said so asked Lucy Everyone know it said Edmund ask anybody you like But it s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow Let s go home Yes let s said Lucy Oh Edmund I am glad you ve got in too The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of u have been there What fun it will be But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be a good fun for him a for her He would have to admit that Lucy had been right before all the others and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animal but he wa already more than half on the side of the Witch He did not know what he would say or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia By this time they had walked a good way Then suddenly they felt coat around them instead of branch and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room I say said Lucy you do look awful Edmund Don t you feel well I m all right said Edmund but this wa not true He wa feeling very sick Come on then said Lucy let s find the others What a lot we shall have to tell them And what wonderful adventure we shall have now that we re all in it together CHAPTER V Back on This Side of the Door Because the game of hide and seek wa still going on it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others But when at last they were all together which happened in the long room where the suit of armour wa Lucy burst out Peter Susan It s all true Edmund ha seen it too There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe Edmund and I both got in We met one another in there in the wood Go on Edmund tell them all about it What s all this about Ed said Peter And now we come to one of the nastiest thing in this story Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick and sulky and annoyed with Lucy for being right but he hadn t made up his mind what to do When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of He decided to let Lucy down Tell u Ed said Susan And Edmund gave a very superior look a if he were far older than Lucy there wa really only a year s difference and then a little snigger and said Oh yes Lucy and I have been playing pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true Just for fun of course There s nothing there really Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room Edmund who wa becoming a nastier person every minute thought that he had scored a great success and went on at once to say There she go again What s the matter with her That s the worst of young kid they always Look here said Peter turning on him savagely shut up You ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing game with her about it and setting her off again I believe you did it simply out of spite But it s all nonsense said Edmund very taken aback Of course it s all nonsense said Peter that s just the point Lu wa perfectly all right when we left home but since we ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar But whichever it is what good do you think you ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next I thought I thought said Edmund but he couldn t think of anything to say You didn t think anything at all said Peter it s just spite You ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself we ve seen that at school before now Do stop it said Susan it won t make thing any better having a row between you two Let s go and find Lucy It wa not surprising that when they found Lucy a good deal later everyone could see that she had been cry Nothing they could say to her made any difference She stuck to her story and said I don t care what you think and I don t care what you say You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like I know I ve met a Faun in there and I wish I d stayed there and you are all beast beast It wa an unpleasant evening Lucy wa miserable and Edmund wa beginning to feel that his plan wasn t working a well a he had expected The two older one were really beginning to think that Lucy wa out of her mind They stood in the passage talking about it in whisper long after she had gone to bed The result wa that next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor He ll write to Father if he think there is really something wrong with Lu said Peter it s getting beyond u So they went and knocked at the study door and the Professor said Come in and got up and found chair for them and said he wa quite at their disposal Then he sat listening to them with the tip of his finger pressed together and never interrupting till they had finished the whole story After that he said nothing for quite a long time Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected How do you know he asked that your sister s story is not true Oh but began Susan and then stopped Anyone could see from the old man s face that he wa perfectly serious Then Susan pulled herself together and said But Edmund said they had only been pretending That is a point said the Professor which certainly deserves consideration very careful consideration For instance if you will excuse me for asking the question doe your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister a the more reliable I mean which is the more truthful That s just the funny thing about it Sir said Peter Up till now I d have said Lucy every time And what do you think my dear said the Professor turning to Susan Well said Susan in general I d say the same a Peter but this couldn t be true all this about the wood and the Faun That is more than I know said the Professor and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing a very serious thing indeed We were afraid it mightn t even be lying said Susan We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy Madness you mean said the Professor quite coolly Oh you can make your mind easy about that One ha only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad But then said Susan and stopped She had never dreamed that a grown up would talk like the Professor and didn t know what to think Logic said the Professor half to himself Why don t they teach logic at these school There are only three possibility Either your sister is telling lie or she is mad or she is telling the truth You know she doesn t tell lie and it is obvious that she is not mad For the moment then and unless any further evidence turn up we must assume that she is telling the truth Susan looked at him very hard and wa quite sure from the expression on his face that he wa not making fun of them But how could it be true Sir said Peter Why do you say that asked the Professor Well for one thing said Peter if it wa real why doesn t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe I mean there wa nothing there when we looked even Lucy didn t pretend there wa What ha that to do with it said the Professor Well Sir if thing are real they re there all the time Are they said the Professor and Peter did not know quite what to say But there wa no time said Susan Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere even if there wa such a place She came running after u the very moment we were out of the room It wa le than a minute and she pretended to have been away for hour That is the very thing that make her story so likely to be true said the Professor If there really is a door in this house that lead to some other world and I should warn you that this is a very strange house and even I know very little about it if I say she had got into another world I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of it own so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time On the other hand I don t think many girl of her age would invent that idea for themselves If she had been pretending she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story But do you really mean Sir said Peter that there could be other world all over the place just round the corner like that Nothing is more probable said the Professor taking off his spectacle and beginning to polish them while he muttered to himself I wonder what they do teach them at these school But what are we to do said Susan She felt that the conversation wa beginning to get off the point My dear young lady said the Professor suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them there is one plan which no one ha yet suggested and which is well worth trying What s that said Susan We might all try minding our own business said he And that wa the end of that conversation After this thing were a good deal better for Lucy Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all It had become a rather alarming subject And so for a time it looked a if all the adventure were coming to an end but that wa not to be This house of the Professor s which even he knew so little about wa so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it It wa the sort of house that is mentioned in guide book and even in history and well it might be for all manner of story were told about it some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now And when party of sight seer arrived and asked to see the house the Professor always gave them permission and Mrs Macready the housekeeper showed them round telling them about the picture and the armour and the rare book in the library Mrs Macready wa not fond of child and did not like to be interrupted when she wa telling visitor all the thing she knew She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first morning along with a good many other instruction And please remember you re to keep out of the way whenever I m taking a party over the house Just a if any of u would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown ups said Edmund and the other three thought the same That wa how the adventure began for the second time A few morning later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bit when the two girl rushed into the room and said Look out Here come the Macready and a whole gang with her Sharp s the word said Peter and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it into the library they suddenly heard voice ahead of them and realised that Mrs Macready must be bringing her party of sight seer up the back stair instead of up the front stair a they had expected And after that whether it wa that they lost their head or that Mrs Macready wa trying to catch them or that some magic in the house had come to life and wa chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere until at last Susan said Oh bother those tripper Here let s get into the Wardrobe Room till they ve passed No one will follow u in there But the moment they were inside they heard voice in the passage and then someone fumbling at the door and then they saw the handle turning Quick said Peter there s nowhere else and flung open the wardrobe All four of them bundled inside it and sat there panting in the dark Peter held the door closed but did not shut it for of course he remembered a every sensible person doe that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe CHAPTER VI Into the Forest I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away said Susan presently I m getting horribly cramped And what a filthy smell of camphor said Edmund I expect the pocket of these coat are full of it said Susan to keep away moth There s something sticking into my back said Peter And isn t it cold said Susan Now that you mention it it is cold said Peter and hang it all it s wet too What s the matter with this place I m sitting on something wet It s getting wetter every minute He struggled to his foot Let s get out said Edmund they ve gone O o oh said Susan suddenly And everyone asked her what wa the matter I m sitting against a tree said Susan and look It s getting lighter over there By jove you re right said Peter and look there and there It s tree all round And this wet stuff is snow Why I do believe we ve got into Lucy s wood after all And now there wa no mistaking it and all four child stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day Behind them were coat hanging on peg in front of them were snow covered tree Peter turned at once to Lucy I apologise for not believing you he said I m sorry Will you shake hand Of course said Lucy and did And now said Susan what do we do next Do said Peter why go and explore the wood of course Ugh said Susan stamping her foot it s pretty cold What about putting on some of these coat They re not ours said Peter doubtfully I am sure nobody would mind said Susan It isn t a if we wanted to take them out of the house we shan t take them even out of the wardrobe I never thought of that Su said Peter Of course now you put it that way I see No one could say you had bagged a coat a long a you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe They immediately carried out Susan s very sensible plan The coat were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heel and looked more like royal robe than coat when they had put them on But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get up and more suitable to the landscape We can pretend we are Arctic explorer said Lucy This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending said Peter a he began leading the way forward into the forest There were heavy darkish cloud overhead and it looked a if there might be more snow before night I say began Edmund presently oughtn t we to be bearing a bit more to the left that is if we are aiming for the lamp post He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before The moment the word were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away Everyone stopped everyone stared at him Peter whistled So you really were here he said that time Lu said she d met you in here and you made out she wa telling lie There wa a dead silence Well of all the poisonous little beast said Peter and shrugged his shoulder and said no more There seemed indeed no more to say and presently the four resumed their journey but Edmund wa saying to himself I ll pay you all out for this you pack of stuck up self satisfied prig Where are we going anyway said Susan chiefly for the sake of changing the subject I think Lu ought to be the leader said Peter goodness know she deserves it Where will you take u Lu What about going to see Mr Tumnus said Lucy He s the nice Faun I told you about Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their foot Lucy proved a good leader At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way but she recognised an odd looking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus cave But there a terrible surprise awaited them The door had been wrenched off it hinge and broken to bit Inside the cave wa dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several day Snow had drifted in from the doorway and wa heaped on the floor mixed with something black which turned out to be the charred stick and ash from the fire Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun s father had been slashed into shred with a knife This is a pretty good wash out said Edmund not much good coming here What s this said Peter stooping down He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor Is there anything written on it asked Susan Yes I think there is answered Peter but I can t read it in this light Let s get out into the open air They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter a he read out the following word The former occupant of these premise the Faun Tumnus is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis Queen of Narnia Chatelaine of Cair Paravel Empress of the Lone Islands etc also of comforting her said Majesty s enemy harbouring spy and fraternising with Humans Signed FENRIS ULF Captain of the Secret Police LONG LIVE THE QUEEN The child stared at each other I don t know that I m going to like this place after all said Susan Who is this Queen Lu said Peter Do you know anything about her She isn t a real queen at all answered Lucy she s a horrible witch the White Witch Everyone all the wood people hate her She ha made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas I I wonder if there s any point in going on said Susan I mean it doesn t seem particularly safe here and it look a if it won t be much fun either And it s getting colder every minute and we ve brought nothing to eat What about just going home Oh but we can t we can t said Lucy suddenly Don t you see We can t just go home not after this It is all on my account that the poor Faun ha got into this trouble He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back That s what it mean by comforting the Queen s enemy and fraternising with Humans We simply must try to rescue him A lot we could do said Edmund when we haven t even got anything to eat Shut up you said Peter who wa still very angry with Edmund What do you think Susan I ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right said Susan I don t want to go a step further and I wish we d never come But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever his name is I mean the Faun That s what I feel too said Peter I m worried about having no food with u I d vote for going back and getting something from the larder only there doesn t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you ve got out of it I think we ll have to go on So do I said both the girl If only we knew where the poor chap wa imprisoned said Peter They were all still wondering what to do next when Lucy said Look There s a robin with such a red breast It s the first bird I ve seen here I say I wonder can bird talk in Narnia It almost look a if it wanted to say something to u Then she turned to the Robin and said Please can you tell u where Tumnus the Faun ha been taken to As she said this she took a step towards the bird It at once hopped away but only a far a to the next tree There it perched and looked at them very hard a if it understood all they had been saying Almost without noticing that they had done so the four child went a step or two nearer to it At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard You couldn t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye Do you know said Lucy I really believe he mean u to follow him I ve an idea he doe said Susan what do you think Peter Well we might a well try it answered Peter The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly It kept going from tree to tree always a few yard ahead of them but always so near that they could easily follow it In this way it led them on slightly down hill Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch Presently the cloud parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour with the two girl in front when Edmund said to Peter If you re not still too high and mighty to talk to me I ve something to say which you d better listen to What is it asked Peter Hush Not so loud said Edmund there s no good frightening the girl But have you realised what we re doing What said Peter lowering his voice to a whisper We re following a guide we know nothing about How do we know which side that bird is on Why shouldn t it be leading u into a trap That s a nasty idea Still a robin you know They re good bird in all the story I ve ever read I m sure a robin wouldn t be on the wrong side If it come to that which is the right side How do we know that the faun are in the right and the Queen yes I know we ve been told she s a witch is in the wrong We don t really know anything about either The Faun saved Lucy He said he did But how do we know And there s another thing too Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here Great Scott said Peter I hadn t thought of that And no chance of dinner either said Edmund CHAPTER VII A Day with the Beavers While the two boy were whispering behind both the girl suddenly cried Oh and stopped The robin cried Lucy the robin It s flown away And so it had right out of sight And now what are we to do said Edmund giving Peter a look which wa a much a to say What did I tell you Sh Look said Susan What said Peter There s something moving among the tree over there to the left They all stared a hard a they could and no one felt very comfortable There it go again said Susan presently I saw it that time too said Peter It s still there It s just gone behind that big tree What is it asked Lucy trying very hard not to sound nervous Whatever it is said Peter it s dodging u It s something that doesn t want to be seen Let s go home said Susan And then though nobody said it out loud everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter They were lost What s it like said Lucy It s it s a kind of animal said Susan and then Look Look Quick There it is They all saw it this time a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree But this time it didn t immediately draw back Instead the animal put it paw against it mouth just a human put their finger on their lip when they are signalling to you to be quiet Then it disappeared again The child all stood holding their breath A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree glanced all round a if it were afraid someone wa watching said Hush made sign to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it wa standing and then once more disappeared I know what it is said Peter it s a beaver I saw the tail It want u to go to it said Susan and it is warning u not to make a noise I know said Peter The question is are we to go to it or not What do you think Lu I think it s a nice beaver said Lucy Yes but how do we know said Edmund Shan t we have to risk it said Susan I mean it s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner At this moment the Beaver again popped it head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them Come on said Peter let s give it a try All keep close together We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turn out to be an enemy So the child all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it and there sure enough they found the Beaver but it still drew back saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper Further in come further in Right in here We re not safe in the open Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four tree grew so close together that their bough met and the brown earth and pine needle could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there did it begin to talk to them Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve it said We re some of them said Peter S s s sh said the Beaver not so loud please We re not safe even here Why who are you afraid of said Peter There s no one here but ourselves There are the tree said the Beaver They re always listening Most of them are on our side but there are tree that would betray u to her you know who I mean and it nodded it head several time If it come to talking about side said Edmund how do we know you re a friend Not meaning to be rude Mr Beaver added Peter but you see we re stranger Quite right quite right said the Beaver Here is my token With these word it held up to them a little white object They all looked at it in surprise till suddenly Lucy said Oh of course It s my handkerchief the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus That s right said the Beaver Poor fellow he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to Here the Beaver s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nod Then signalling to the child to stand a close around it a they possibly could so that their face were actually tickled by it whisker it added in a low whisper They say Aslan is on the move perhaps ha already landed And now a very curious thing happened None of the child knew who Aslan wa any more than you do but the moment the Beaver had spoken these word everyone felt quite different Perhaps it ha sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone say something which you don t understand but in the dream it feel a if it had some enormous meaning either a terrifying one which turn the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into word which make the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again It wa like that now At the name of Aslan each one of the child felt something jump in his inside Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous Susan felt a if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holiday or the beginning of summer And what about Mr Tumnus said Lucy where is he S s s sh said the Beaver not here I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the Beaver now and everyone including Edmund wa very glad to hear the word dinner They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace and always in the thickest part of the forest for over an hour Everyone wa feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the tree began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply down hill A minute later they came out under the open sky the sun wa still shining and found themselves looking down on a fine sight They were standing on the edge of a steep narrow valley at the bottom of which ran at least it would have been running if it hadn t been frozen a fairly large river Just below them a dam had been built across this river and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beaver are always making dam and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they ve made or reading a story they ve written So it wa only common politeness when Susan said What a lovely dam And Mr Beaver didn t say Hush this time but Merely a trifle Merely a trifle And it isn t really finished Above the dam there wa what ought to have been a deep pool but wa now of course a level floor of dark green ice And below the dam much lower down wa more ice but instead of being smooth this wa all frozen into the foamy and wavy shape in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there wa now a glittering wall of icicle a if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flower and wreath and festoon of the purest sugar And out in the middle and partly on the top of the dam wa a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous bee hive and from a hole in the roof smoke wa going up so that when you saw it especially if you were hungry you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before That wa what the others chiefly noticed but Edmund noticed something else A little lower down the river there wa another small river which came down another small valley to join it And looking up that valley Edmund could see two small hill and he wa almost sure they were the two hill which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp post that other day And then between them he thought must be her palace only a mile off or le And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King And I wonder how Peter will like that he asked himself and horrible idea came into his head Here we are said Mr Beaver and it look a if Mrs Beaver is expecting u I ll lead the way But be careful and don t slip The top of the dam wa wide enough to walk on though not for human a very nice place to walk because it wa covered with ice and though the frozen pool wa level with it on one side there wa a nasty drop to the lower river on the other Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house Here we are Mrs Beaver said Mr Beaver I ve found them Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve and they all went in The first thing Lucy noticed a she went in wa a burring sound and the first thing she saw wa a kind looking old she beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine and it wa from it that the sound came She stopped her work and got up a soon a the child came in So you ve come at last she said holding out both her wrinkled old paw At last To think that ever I should live to see this day The potato are on boiling and the kettle s singing and I daresay Mr Beaver you ll get u some fish That I will said Mr Beaver and he went out of the house Peter went with him and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet They took a pail with them Mr Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole he didn t seem to mind it s being so chilly looked hard into it then suddenly shot in his paw and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish Meanwhile the girl were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plate in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house and to put on the frying pan and get the dripping hot Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it wa not at all like Mr Tumnus s cave There were no book or picture and instead of bed there were bunk like on board ship built into the wall And there were ham and string of onion hanging from the roof and against the wall were gum boot and oilskin and hatchet and pair of shear and spade and trowel and thing for carrying mortar in and fishing rod and fishing net and sack And the cloth on the table tho very clean wa very rough Just a the frying pan wa nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fish which Mr Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air You can think how good the new caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry child longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mrs Beaver said Now we re nearly ready Susan drained the potato and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy wa helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout so that in a very few minute everyone wa drawing up stool it wa all three legged stool in the Beavers house except for Mrs Beaver s own special rocking chair beside the fire and preparing to enjoy themselves There wa a jug of creamy milk for the child Mr Beaver stuck to beer and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took a much a he wanted to go with his potato and all the child thought and I agree with them that there s nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat it when it ha been alive half an hour ago and ha come out of the pan half a minute ago And when they had finished the fish Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll steaming hot and at the same time moved the kettle on to the fire so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea wa made and ready to be poured out And when each person had got his or her cup of tea each person shoved back his or her stool so a to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment And now said Mr Beaver pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him if you ll just wait till I ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely why now we can get to business It s snowing again he added cocking his eye at the window That s all the better because it mean we shan t have any visitor and if anyone should have been trying to follow you why he won t find any track CHAPTER VIII What Happened after Dinner And now said Lucy do please tell u what s happened to Mr Tumnus Ah that s bad said Mr Beaver shaking his head That s a very very bad business There s no doubt he wa taken off by the police I got that from a bird who saw it done But where s he been taken to asked Lucy Well they were heading northward when they were last seen and we all know what that mean No we don t said Susan But Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion I m afraid it mean they were taking him to her house said Mr Beaver But what ll they do to him Mr Beaver gasped Lucy Well said Mr Beaver you can t exactly say for sure But there s not many taken in there that ever come out again Statues All full of statue they say it is in the courtyard and up the stair and in the hall People she s turned he paused and shuddered turned into stone But Mr Beaver said Lucy can t we I mean we must do something to save him It s too dreadful and it s all on my account I don t doubt you d save him if you could dearie said Mrs Beaver but you ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive Couldn t we have some stratagem said Peter I mean couldn t we dress up a something or pretend to be oh pedlar or anything or watch till she wa gone out or oh hang it all there must be some way This Faun saved my sister at his own risk Mr Beaver We can t just leave him to be to be to have that done to him It s no good Son of Adam said Mr Beaver no good your trying of all people But now that Aslan is on the move Oh yes Tell u about Aslan said several voice at once for once again that strange feeling like the first sign of spring like good news had come over them Who is Aslan asked Susan Aslan said Mr Beaver Why don t you know He s the King He s the Lord of the whole wood but not often here you understand Never in my time or my father s time But the word ha reached u that he ha come back He is in Narnia at this moment He ll settle the White Queen all right It is he not you that will save Mr Tumnus She won t turn him into stone too said Edmund Lord love you Son of Adam what a simple thing to say answered Mr Beaver with a great laugh Turn him into stone If she can stand on her two foot and look him in the face it ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her No no He ll put all to right a it say in an old rhyme in these part Wrong will be right when Aslan come in sight At the sound of his roar sorrow will be no more When he bares his teeth winter meet it death And when he shake his mane we shall have spring again You ll understand when you see him But shall we see him asked Susan Why Daughter of Eve that s what I brought you here for I m to lead you where you shall meet him said Mr Beaver Is is he a man asked Lucy Aslan a man said Mr Beaver sternly Certainly not I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor Beyond the Sea Don t you know who is the King of Beasts Aslan is a lion the Lion the great Lion Ooh said Susan I d thought he wa a man Is he quite safe I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion That you will dearie and no mistake said Mrs Beaver if there s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knee knocking they re either braver than most or else just silly Then he isn t safe said Lucy Safe said Mr Beaver Don t you hear what Mrs Beaver tell you Who said anything about safe Course he isn t safe But he s good He s the King I tell you I m longing to see him said Peter even if I do feel frightened when it come to the point That s right Son of Adam said Mr Beaver bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cup and saucer rattle And so you shall Word ha been sent that you are to meet him to morrow if you can at the Stone Table Where s that said Lucy I ll show you said Mr Beaver It s down the river a good step from here I ll take you to it But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus said Lucy The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan said Mr Beaver once he s with u then we can begin doing thing Not that we don t need you too For that s another of the old rhyme When Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Sits at Cair Paravel in throne The evil time will be over and done So thing must be drawing near their end now he s come and you ve come We ve heard of Aslan coming into these part before long ago nobody can say when But there s never been any of your race here before That s what I don t understand Mr Beaver said Peter I mean isn t the Witch herself human She d like u to believe it said Mr Beaver and it s on that that she base her claim to be Queen But she s no Daughter of Eve She come of your father Adam s here Mr Beaver bowed your father Adam s first wife her they called Lilith And she wa one of the Jinn That s what she come from on one side And on the other she come of the giant No no there isn t a drop of real Human blood in the Witch That s why she s bad all through Mr Beaver said Mrs Beaver True enough Mrs Beaver replied he there may be two view about Humans meaning no offence to the present company But there s no two view about thing that look like Humans and aren t I ve known good dwarf said Mrs Beaver So ve I now you come to speak of it said her husband but precious few and they were the one least like men But in general take my advice when you meet anything that s going to be Human and isn t yet or used to be Human once and isn t now or ought to be Human and isn t you keep your eye on it and feel for your hatchet And that s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia She s been watching for you this many a year and if she knew there were four of you she d be more dangerous still What s that to do with it asked Peter Because of another prophecy said Mr Beaver Down at Cair Paravel that s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all wa a it should be down at Cair Paravel there are four throne and it s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four throne then it will be the end not only of the White Witch s reign but of her life and that is why we had to be so cautious a we came along for if she knew about you four your life wouldn t be worth a shake of my whisker All the child had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver wa telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark Lucy suddenly said I say where s Edmund There wa a dreadful pause and then everyone began asking Who saw him last How long ha he been missing Is he outside And then all rushed to the door and looked out The snow wa falling thickly and steadily the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank Out they went plunging well over their ankle into the soft new snow and went round the house in every direction Edmund Edmund they called till they were hoarse But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voice and there wa not even an echo in answer How perfectly dreadful said Susan a they at last came back in despair Oh how I wish we d never come What on earth are we to do Mr Beaver said Peter Do said Mr Beaver who wa already putting on his snow boot do We must be off at once We haven t a moment to spare We d better divide into four search party said Peter and all go in different direction Whoever find him must come back here at once and Search party Son of Adam said Mr Beaver what for Why to look for Edmund of course There s no point in looking for him said Mr Beaver What do you mean said Susan he can t be far away yet And we ve got to find him What do you mean when you say there s no use looking for him The reason there s no use looking said Mr Beaver is that we know already where he s gone Everyone stared in amazement Don t you understand said Mr Beaver He s gone to her to the White Witch He ha betrayed u all Oh surely oh really said Susan he can t have done that Can t he said Mr Beaver looking very hard at the three child and everything they wanted to say died on their lip for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this wa exactly what Edmund had done But will he know the way said Peter Has he been in this country before asked Mr Beaver ha he ever been here alone Yes said Lucy almost in a whisper I m afraid he ha And did he tell you what he d done or who he d met Well no he didn t said Peter Then mark my word said Mr Beaver he ha already met the White Witch and joined her side and been told where she life I didn t like to mention it before he being your brother and all but the moment I set eye on that brother of yours I said to myself Treacherous He had the look of one who ha been with the Witch and eaten her food You can always tell them if you ve lived long in Narnia something about their eye All the same said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice we ll still have to go and look for him He is our brother after all even if he is rather a little beast and he s only a kid Go to the Witch s house said Mrs Beaver Don t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her How do you mean said Lucy Why all she want is to get all four of you she s thinking all the time of those four throne at Cair Paravel Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done and there d be four new statue in her collection before you d had time to speak But she ll keep him alive a long a he s the only one she s got because she ll want to use him a a decoy a bait to catch the rest of you with Oh can no one help u wailed Lucy Only Aslan said Mr Beaver we must go on and meet him That s our only chance now It seems to me my dear said Mrs Beaver that it is very important to know just when he slipped away How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard For instance had we started talking of Aslan before he left If not then we may do very well for she won t know that Aslan ha come to Narnia or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard a far a that is concerned I don t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan began Peter but Lucy interrupted him Oh yes he wa she said miserably don t you remember it wa he who asked whether the Witch couldn t turn Aslan into stone too So he did by Jove said Peter just the sort of thing he would say too Worse and worse said Mr Beaver and the next thing is this Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan wa the Stone Table And of course no one knew the answer to this question Because if he wa continued Mr Beaver then she ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between u and the Stone Table and catch u on our way down In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan But that isn t what she ll do first said Mrs Beaver not if I know her The moment that Edmund tell her that we re all here she ll set out to catch u this very night and if he s been gone about half an hour she ll be here in about another twenty minute You re right Mrs Beaver said her husband we must all get away from here There s not a moment to lose CHAPTER IX In the Witch s House And now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund He had eaten his share of the dinner but he hadn t really enjoyed it because he wa thinking all the time about Turkish Delight and there s nothing that spoil the taste of good ordinary food half so much a the memory of bad magic food And he had heard the conversation and hadn t enjoyed it much either because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder They weren t but he imagined it And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table It wa then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just a it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling Just a Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door handle and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn t really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him You mustn t think that even now Edmund wa quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sister to be turned into stone He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince and later a King and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast As for what the Witch would do with the others he didn t want her to be particularly nice to them certainly not to put them on the same level a himself but he managed to believe or to pretend he believed that she wouldn t do anything very bad to them Because he said to himself all these people who say nasty thing about her are her enemy and probably half of it isn t true She wa jolly nice to me anyway much nicer than they are I expect she is the rightful Queen really Anyway she ll be better than that awful Aslan At least that wa the excuse he made in his own mind for what he wa doing It wasn t a very good excuse however for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch wa bad and cruel The first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all around him wa that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers house And of course there wa no chance of going back to get it now The next thing he realised wa that the daylight wa almost gone for it had been nearly three o clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter day were short He hadn t reckoned on this but he had to make the best of it So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam luckily it wasn t so slippery since the snow had fallen to the far side of the river It wa pretty bad when he reached the far side It wa growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflake swirling all round him he could hardly see three foot ahead And then too there wa no road He kept slipping into deep drift of snow and skidding on frozen puddle and tripping over fallen tree trunk and sliding down steep bank and barking his shin against rock till he wa wet and cold and bruised all over The silence and the loneliness were dreadful In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friend with the others if he hadn t happened to say to himself When I m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent road And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other thing he would do and this cheered him up a good deal He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many car and all about his private cinema and where the principal railway would run and what law he would make against beaver and dam and wa putting the finishing touch to some scheme for keeping Peter in his place when the weather changed First the snow stopped Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold Finally the cloud rolled away and the moon came out It wa a full moon and shining on all that snow it made everything almost a bright a day only the shadow were rather confusing He would never have found his way if the moon hadn t come out by the time he got to the other river you remember he had seen when they first arrived at the Beavers a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down He now reached this and turned to follow it up But the little valley down which it came wa much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bush so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark Even a it wa he got wet through for he had to stoop to go under branch and great load of snow came sliding off on to his back And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter just a if all this had been Peter s fault But at last he came to a part where it wa more level and the valley opened out And there on the other side of the river quite close to him in the middle of a little plain between two hill he saw what must be the White Witch s house And the moon wa shining brighter than ever The house wa really a small castle It seemed to be all tower little tower with long pointed spire on them sharp a needle They looked like huge dunce s cap or sorcerer s cap And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadow looked strange on the snow Edmund began to be afraid of the house But it wa too late to think of turning back now He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the house There wa nothing stirring not the slightest sound anywhere Even his own foot made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow He walked on and on past corner after corner of the house and past turret after turret to find the door He had to go right round to the far side before he found it It wa a huge arch but the great iron gate stood wide open Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating Just inside the gate with the moonlight shining on it stood an enormous lion crouched a if it wa ready to spring And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch afraid to go on and afraid to go back with his knee knocking together He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear How long this really lasted I don t know but it seemed to Edmund to last for hour Then at last he began to wonder why the lion wa standing so still for it hadn t moved one inch since he first set eye on it Edmund now ventured a little nearer still keeping in the shadow of the arch a much a he could He now saw from the way the lion wa standing that it couldn t have been looking at him at all But supposing it turn it head thought Edmund In fact it wa staring at something else namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four foot away Aha thought Edmund When it spring at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape But still the lion never moved nor did the dwarf And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone Perhaps this wa only a stone lion And a soon a he had thought of that he noticed that the lion s back and the top of it head were covered with snow Of course it must be only a statue No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow Then very slowly and with his heart beating a if it would burst Edmund ventured to go up to the lion Even now he hardly dared to touch it but at last he put out his hand very quickly and did It wa cold stone He had been frightened of a mere statue The relief which Edmund felt wa so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toe and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea Probably he thought this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about She s caught him already and turned him into stone So that s the end of all their fine idea about him Pooh Who s afraid of Aslan And he stood there gloating over the stone lion and presently he did something very silly and childish He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion s upper lip and then a pair of spectacle on it eye Then he said Yah Silly old Aslan How do you like being a stone You thought yourself mighty fine didn t you But in spite of the scribble on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible and sad and noble staring up in the moonlight that Edmund didn t really get any fun out of jeering at it He turned away and began to cross the courtyard As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozen of statue all about standing here and there rather a the piece stand on a chess board when it is half way through the game There were stone satyr and stone wolf and bear and fox and cat a mountain of stone There were lovely stone shape that looked like woman but who were really the spirit of tree There wa the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon They all looked so strange standing there perfectly lifelike and also perfectly still in the bright cold moonlight that it wa eerie work crossing the courtyard Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man but a tall a a tree with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in it right hand Even though he knew that it wa only a stone giant and not a live one Edmund did not like going past it He now saw that there wa a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard He went to it there wa a flight of stone step going up to an open door Edmund went up them Across the threshold lay a great wolf It s all right it s all right he kept saying to himself it s only a stone wolf It can t hurt me and he raised his leg to step over it Instantly the huge creature rose with all the hair bristling along it back opened a great red mouth and said in a growling voice Who s there Who s there Stand still stranger and tell me who you are If you please Sir said Edmund trembling so that he could hardly speak my name is Edmund and I m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sister are now in Narnia quite close in the Beavers house She she wanted to see them I will tell Her Majesty said the Wolf Meanwhile stand still on the threshold a you value your life Then it vanished into the house Edmund stood and waited his finger aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest and presently the grey Wolf Fenris Ulf the Chief of the Witch s Secret Police came bounding back and said Come in Come in Fortunate favourite of the Queen or else not so fortunate And Edmund went in taking great care not to tread on the Wolf s paw He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillar full a the courtyard had been of statue The one nearest the door wa a little Faun with a very sad expression on it face and Edmund couldn t help wondering if this might be Lucy s friend The only light came from a single lamp and close behind this sat the White Witch I m come your Majesty said Edmund rushing eagerly forward How dare you come alone said the Witch in a terrible voice Did I not tell you to bring the others with you Please your Majesty said Edmund I ve done the best I can I ve brought them quite close They re in the little house on top of the dam just up the river with Mr and Mrs Beaver A slow cruel smile came over the Witch s face Is this all your news she asked No your Majesty said Edmund and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers house What Aslan cried the Queen Aslan Is this true If I find you have lied to me Please I m only repeating what they said stammered Edmund But the Queen who wa no longer attending to him clapped her hand Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared Make ready our sledge ordered the Witch and use the harness without bell CHAPTER X The Spell Begins to Break Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other child As soon a Mr Beaver said There s no time to lose everyone began bundling themselves into coat except Mrs Beaver who started picking up sack and laying them on the table and said Now Mr Beaver just reach down that ham And here s a packet of tea and there s sugar and some match And if someone will get two or three loaf out of the crock over there in the corner What are you doing Mrs Beaver exclaimed Susan Packing a load for each of u dearie said Mrs Beaver very coolly You didn t think we d set out on a journey with nothing to eat did you But we haven t time said Susan buttoning the collar of her coat She may be here any minute That s what I say chimed in Mr Beaver Get along with you all said his wife Think it over Mr Beaver She can t be here for a quarter of an hour at least But don t we want a big a start a we can possibly get said Peter if we re to reach the Stone Table before her You ve got to remember that Mrs Beaver said Susan As soon a she ha looked in here and find we re gone she ll be off at top speed That she will said Mrs Beaver But we can t get there before her whatever we do for she ll be on a sledge and we ll be walking Then have we no hope said Susan Now don t you get fussing there s a dear said Mrs Beaver but just get half a dozen clean handkerchief out of that drawer Course we ve got a hope We can t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by way she won t expect and perhaps we ll get through That s true enough Mrs Beaver said her husband But it s time we were out of this And don t you start fussing either Mr Beaver said his wife There That s better There s four load and the smallest for the smallest of u that s you my dear she added looking at Lucy Oh do please come on said Lucy Well I m nearly ready now answered Mrs Beaver at last allowing her husband to help her into her snow boot I suppose the sewing machine s too heavy to bring Yes It is said Mr Beaver A great deal too heavy And you don t think you ll be able to use it while we re on the run I suppose I can t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it said Mrs Beaver and breaking it or stealing it a likely a not Oh please please please do hurry said the three child And so at last they all got outside and Mr Beaver locked the door It ll delay her a bit he said and they set off all carrying their load over their shoulder The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey They went in single file first Mr Beaver then Lucy then Peter then Susan and Mrs Beaver last of all Mr Beaver led them across the dam and onto the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the tree right down by the river bank The side of the valley shining in the moonlight towered up far above them on either hand Best keep down here a much a possible he said She ll have to keep to the top for you couldn t bring a sledge down here It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair and even a thing were Lucy enjoyed it at first But a they went on walking and walking and walking and a the sack she wa carrying felt heavier and heavier she began to wonder how she wa going to keep up at all And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all it waterfall of ice and at the white mass of the tree top and the great glaring moon and the countless star and could only watch the little short leg of Mr Beaver going pad pad pad pad through the snow in front of her a if they were never going to stop Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more And at last Lucy wa so tired that she wa almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the river bank to the right and wa leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bush And then a she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver wa just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bush until you were quite on top of it In fact by the time she realised what wa happening only his short flat tail wa showing Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him Then she heard noise of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside Wherever is this said Peter s voice sounding tired and pale in the darkness I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale It s an old hiding place for beaver in bad time said Mr Beaver and a great secret It s not much of a place but we must get a few hour sleep If you hadn t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting I d have brought some pillow said Mrs Beaver It wasn t nearly such a nice cave a Mr Tumnus s Lucy thought just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy It wa very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of fur and clothes together and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you d swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep It seemed to Lucy only the next minute though really it wa hour and hour later when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath Then she felt a set of long whisker tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave But immediately after that she wa very wide awake indeed and so wa everyone else In fact they were all sitting up with their mouth and eye wide open listening to a sound which wa the very sound they d all been thinking of and sometimes imagining they heard during their walk last night It wa a sound of jingling bell Mr Beaver wa out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it Perhaps you think a Lucy thought for a moment that this wa a very silly thing for him to do But it wa really a very sensible one He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bush and bramble without being seen and he wanted above all thing to see which way the Witch s sledge went The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering They waited nearly five minute Then they heard something that frightened them very much They heard voice Oh thought Lucy he s been seen She s caught him Great wa their surprise when a little later they heard Mr Beaver s voice calling to them from just outside the cave It s all right he wa shouting Come out Mrs Beaver Come out Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve It s all right It isn t her This wa bad grammar of course but that is how beaver talk when they are excited I mean in Narnia in our world they usually don t talk at all So Mrs Beaver and the child came bundling out of the cave all blinking in the daylight and with earth all over them and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eye Come on cried Mr Beaver who wa almost dancing with delight Come and see This is a nasty knock for the Witch It look a if her power wa already crumbling What do you mean Mr Beaver panted Peter a they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together Didn t I tell you answered Mr Beaver that she d made it always winter and never Christmas Didn t I tell you Well just come and see And then they were all at the top and did see It wa a sledge and it wa reindeer with bell on their harness But they were far bigger than the Witch s reindeer and they were not white but brown And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eye on him He wa a huge man in a bright red robe bright a holly berry with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest Everyone knew him because though you see people of his sort only in Narnia you see picture of them and hear them talked about even in our world the world on this side of the wardrobe door But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different Some of the picture of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly But now that the child actually stood looking at him they didn t find it quite like that He wa so big and so glad and so real that they all became quite still They felt very glad but also solemn I ve come at last said he She ha kept me out for a long time but I have got in at last Aslan is on the move The Witch s magic is weakening And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still And now said Father Christmas for your present There is a new and better sewing machine for you Mrs Beaver I will drop it in your house a I pas If you please sir said Mrs Beaver making a curtsey It s locked up Locks and bolt make no difference to me said Father Christmas And a for you Mr Beaver when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leak stopped and a new sluice gate fitted Mr Beaver wa so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn t say anything at all Peter Adam s Son said Father Christmas Here Sir said Peter These are your present wa the answer and they are tool not toy The time to use them is perhaps near at hand Bear them well With these word he handed to Peter a shield and a sword The shield wa the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion a bright a a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it The hilt of the sword wa of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed and it wa just the right size and weight for Peter to use Peter wa silent and solemn a he received these gift for he felt they were a very serious kind of present Susan Eve s Daughter said Father Christmas These are for you and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrow and a little ivory horn You must use the bow only in great need he said for I do not mean you to fight in the battle It doe not easily miss And when you put this horn to your lip and blow it then wherever you are I think help of some kind will come to you Last of all he said Lucy Eve s Daughter and Lucy came forward He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass but people said afterwards that it wa made of diamond and a small dagger In this bottle he said there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire flower that grow in the mountain of the sun If you or any of your friend are hurt a few drop of this will restore you And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need For you also are not to be in the battle Why Sir said Lucy I think I don t know but I think I could be brave enough That is not the point he said But battle are ugly when woman fight And now here he suddenly looked le grave here is something for the moment for you all and he brought out I suppose from the big bag at his back but nobody quite saw him do it a large tray containing five cup and saucer a bowl of lump sugar a jug of cream and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot Then he cried out A Merry Christmas Long live the true King and cracked his whip and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started Peter had just drawn his sword out of it sheath and wa showing it to Mr Beaver when Mrs Beaver said Now then now then Don t stand talking there till the tea s got cold Just like men Come and help to carry the tray down and we ll have breakfast What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread knife So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwich and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed himself But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said Time to be moving on now CHAPTER XI Aslan Is Nearer Edmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time When the Dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him a she had been at their last meeting But she said nothing at all And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say Please your Majesty could I have some Turkish Delight You you said she answered Silence fool Then she appeared to change her mind and said a if to herself And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way and once more clapped her hand Another dwarf appeared Bring the human creature food and drink she said The Dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it He grinned in a repulsive manner a he set them down the floor beside Edmund and said Turkish Delight for the little Prince Ha Ha Ha Take it away said Edmund sulkily I don t want dry bread But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologised and began to nibble at the bread though it wa so stale he could hardly get it down You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again said the Witch While he wa still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge wa ready The White Witch rose and went out ordering Edmund to go with her The snow wa again falling a they came into the courtyard but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge But before they drove off she called Fenris Ulf and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge Take with you the swiftest of your wolf and go at once to the house of the Beavers said the Witch and kill whatever you find there If they are already gone then make all speed to the Stone Table but do not be seen Wait for me there in hiding I meanwhile must go many mile to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river You may overtake these human before they reach the Stone Table You will know what to do if you find them I hear and obey O Queen growled the Wolf and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness a quickly a a horse can gallop In a few minute he had called another wolf and wa with him down on the dam and sniffing at the Beavers house But of course they found it empty It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the child if the night had remained fine for the wolf would then have been able to follow their trail and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave But now that the snow had begun again the scent wa cold and even the footprint were covered up Meanwhile the Dwarf whipped up the reindeer and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold This wa a terrible journey for Edmund who had no coat Before they had been going a quarter of ah hour all the front of him wa covered with snow he soon stopped trying to shake it off because a quickly a he did that a new lot gathered and he wa so tired Soon he wa wet to the skin And oh how miserable he wa It didn t look now a if the Witch intended to make him a King All the thing he had said to make himself believe that she wa good and kind and that her side wa really the right side sounded to him silly now He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment even Peter The only way to comfort himself now wa to try to believe that the whole thing wa a dream and that he might wake up at any moment And a they went on hour after hour it did come to seem like a dream This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote page and page about it But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight And still they went on and on with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer s harness And then at last the Witch said What have we here Stop and they did How Edmund hoped she wa going to say something about breakfast But she had stopped for quite a different reason A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party a squirrel and his wife with their child and two satyr and a dwarf and an old dog fox all on stool round a table Edmund couldn t quite see what they were eating but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decoration of holly and he wasn t at all sure that he didn t see something like a plum pudding At the moment when the sledge stopped the Fox who wa obviously the oldest person present had just risen to it foot holding a glass in it right paw a if it wa going to say something But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who wa in it all the gaiety went out of their face The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half way to his mouth and one of the satyr stopped with it fork actually in it mouth and the baby squirrel squealed with terror What is the meaning of this asked the Witch Queen Nobody answered Speak vermin she said again Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip What is the meaning of all this gluttony this waste this self indulgence Where did you get all these thing Please your Majesty said the Fox we were given them And if I might make so bold a to drink your Majesty s very good health Who gave them to you said the Witch F F F Father Christmas stammered the Fox What roared the Witch springing from the sledge and taking a few stride nearer to the terrified animal He ha not been here He can not have been here How dare you but no Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven At that moment one of the young squirrel lost it head completely He ha he ha he ha it squeaked beating it little spoon on the table Edmund saw the Witch bite her lip so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek Then she raised her wand Oh don t don t please don t shouted Edmund but even while he wa shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statue of creature one with it stone fork fixed forever half way to it stone mouth seated round a stone table on which there were stone plate and a stone plum pudding As for you said the Witch giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face a she re mounted the sledge let that teach you to ask favour for spy and traitor Drive on And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figure sitting there all the silent day and all the dark night year after year till the moss grew on them and at last even their face crumbled away Now they were steadily racing on again And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them a they rushed through it wa much wetter than it had been all last night At the same time he noticed that he wa feeling much le cold It wa also becoming foggy In fact every minute it grew both foggier and warmer And the sledge wa not running nearly a well a it had been running up till now At first he thought this wa because the reindeer were tired but soon he saw that that couldn t be the real reason The sledge jerked and skidded and kept on jolting a if it had struck against stone And however the Dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them but the noise of their driving and jolting and the Dwarf s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it wa until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn t go on at all When that happened there wa a moment s silence And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly A strange sweet rustling chattering noise and yet not so strange for he knew he d heard it before if only he could remember where Then all at once he did remember It wa the noise of running water All round them though out of sight there were stream chattering murmuring bubbling splashing and even in the distance roaring And his heart gave a great leap though he hardly knew why when he realised that the frost wa over And much nearer there wa a drip drip drip from the branch of all the tree And then a he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree But he hadn t time to listen or watch any longer for the Witch said Don t sit staring fool Get out and help And of course Edmund had to obey He stepped out into the snow but it wa really only slush by now and began helping the Dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into They got it out in the end and by being very cruel to the reindeer the Dwarf managed to get it on the move again and they drove a little further And now the snow wa really melting in earnest and patch of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction Unless you have looked at a world of snow a long a Edmund had been looking at it you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patch were after the endless white Then the sledge stopped again It s no good your Majesty said the Dwarf We can t sledge in this thaw Then we must walk said the Witch We shall never overtake them walking growled the dwarf Not with the start they ve got Are you my councillor or my slave said the Witch Do a you re told Tie the hand of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope And take your whip And cut the harness of the reindeer they ll find their own way home The Dwarf obeyed and in a few minute Edmund found himself being forced to walk a fast a he could with his hand tied behind him He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass and every time he slipped the Dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying Faster Faster Every moment the patch of green grew bigger and the patch of snow grew smaller Every moment more and more of the tree shook off their robe of snow Soon wherever you looked instead of white shape you saw the dark green of fir or the black prickly branch of bare oak and beech and elm Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree top Soon there were more wonderful thing happening Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch tree Edmund saw the ground covered in all direction with little yellow flower celandine The noise of water grew louder Presently they actually crossed a stream Beyond it they found snowdrop growing Mind your own business said the Dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them and he gave the rope a vicious jerk But of course this didn t prevent Edmund from seeing Only five minute later he noticed a dozen crocus growing round the foot of an old tree gold and purple and white Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree It wa answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off And then a if that had been a signal there wa chattering and chirruping in every direction and then a moment of full song and within five minute the whole wood wa ringing with bird music and wherever Edmund s eye turned he saw bird alighting on branch or sailing overhead or having their little quarrel Faster Faster said the Witch There wa no trace of the fog now The sky became bluer and bluer and now there were white cloud hurrying across it from time to time In the wide glade there were primrose A light breeze sprang up which scattered drop of moisture from the swaying branch and carried cool delicious scent against the face of the traveller The tree began to come fully alive The larch and birch were covered with green the laburnum with gold Soon the beech tree had put forth their delicate transparent leaf As the traveller walked under them the light also became green A bee buzzed across their path This is no thaw said the Dwarf suddenly stopping This is spring What are we to do Your winter ha been destroyed I tell you This is Aslan s doing If either of you mention that name again said the Witch he shall instantly be killed CHAPTER XII Peter s First Battle While the Dwarf and the White Witch were saying this mile away the Beaver and the child were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream Long ago they had left the coat behind them And by now they had even stopped saying to one another Look There s a kingfisher or I say bluebell or What wa that lovely smell or Just listen to that thrush They walked on in silence drinking it all in passing through patch of warm sunlight into cool green thicket and out again into wide mossy glade where tall elm raised the leafy roof far overhead and then into dense mass of flowering currant and among hawthorn bush where the sweet smell wa almost overpowering They had been just a surprised a Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hour or so from January to May They hadn t even known for certain a the Witch did that this wa what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia But they all knew that it wa her spell which had produced the endless winter and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong and badly wrong with the Witch s scheme And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge After that they didn t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rest and longer one They were pretty tired by now of course but not what I d call bitterly tired only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside a one doe when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open Susan had a slight blister on one heel They had left the course of the big river some time ago for one had to turn a little to the right that meant a little to the South to reach the place of the Stone Table Even if this had not been their way they couldn t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began for with all that melting snow the river wa soon in flood a wonderful roaring thundering yellow flood and their path would have been under water And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadow got longer and the flower began to think about closing Not long now said Mr Beaver and began leading them uphill across some very deep springy moss it felt nice under their tired foot in a place where only tall tree grew very wide apart The climb coming at the end of the long day made them all pant and blow And just a Lucy wa wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest suddenly they were at the top And this is what they saw They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading a far a one could see in every direction except right ahead There far to the East wa something twinkling and moving By gum whispered Peter to Susan The sea In the very middle of this open hilltop wa the Stone Table It wa a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stone It looked very old and it wa cut all over with strange line and figure that might be the letter of an unknown language They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them The next thing they saw wa a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place A wonderful pavilion it wa and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it with side of what looked like yellow silk and cord of crimson and tent peg of ivory and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion fluttered in the breeze which wa blowing in their face from the far off sea While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creature who had grouped themselves around him in the shape of a half moon There were Tree Women there and Well Women Dryads and Naiads a they used to be called in our world who had stringed instrument it wa they who had made the music There were four great centaur The horse part of them wa like huge English farm horse and the man part wa like stern but beautiful giant There wa also a unicorn and a bull with the head of a man and a pelican and an eagle and a great dog And next to Aslan stood two leopard of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard But a for Aslan himself the Beavers and the child didn t know what to do or say when they saw him People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing can not be good and terrible at the same time If the child had ever thought so they were cured of it now For when they tried to look at Aslan s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great royal solemn overwhelming eye and then they found they couldn t look at him and went all trembly Go on whispered Mr Beaver No whispered Peter you first No Sons of Adam before animal whispered Mr Beaver back again Susan whispered Peter what about you Ladies first No you re the eldest whispered Susan And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt Then at last Peter realised that it wa up to him He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others Come on Pull yourselves together he advanced to the Lion and said We have come Aslan Welcome Peter Son of Adam said Aslan Welcome Susan and Lucy Daughters of Eve Welcome He Beaver and She Beaver His voice wa deep and rich and somehow took the fidget out of them They now felt glad and quiet and it didn t seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing But where is the fourth asked Aslan He ha tried to betray them and joined the White Witch O Aslan said Mr Beaver And then something made Peter say That wa partly my fault Aslan I wa angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great golden eye And it seemed to all of them that there wa nothing to be said Please Aslan said Lucy can anything be done to save Edmund All shall be done said Aslan But it may be harder than you think And then he wa silent again for some time Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad a well But next minute that expression wa quite gone The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paw together Terrible paw thought Lucy If he didn t know how to velvet them and said Meanwhile let the feast be prepared Ladies take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them When the girl had gone Aslan laid his paw and though it wa velveted it wa very heavy on Peter s shoulder and said Come Son of Adam and I will show you a far off sight of the castle where you are to be King And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hill top There a beautiful sight met their eye The sun wa setting behind their back That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light forest and hill and valley and winding away like a silver snake the lower part of the great river And beyond all this mile away wa the sea and beyond the sea the sky full of cloud which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset But just where the land of Narnia met the sea in fact at the mouth of the great river there wa something on a little hill shining It wa shining because it wa a castle and of course the sunlight wa reflected from all the window which looked towards Peter and the sunset but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore That O Man said Aslan is Cair Paravel of the four throne in one of which you must sit a King I show it to you because you are the first born and you will be High King over all the rest And once more Peter said nothing for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly It wa like a bugle but richer It is your sister s horn said Aslan to Peter in a low voice so low a to be almost a purr if it is not disrespectful to think of a lion purring For a moment Peter did not understand Then when he saw all the other creature start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw Back Let the Prince win his spur he did understand and set off running a hard a he could to the pavilion And there he saw a dreadful sight The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction Lucy wa running towards him a fast a her short leg would carry her and her face wa a white a paper Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree and swing herself up followed by a huge grey beast At first Peter thought it wa a bear Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian though it wa far too big to be a dog Then he realised that it wa a wolf a wolf standing on it hind leg with it front paw against the tree trunk snapping and snarling All the hair on it back stood up on end Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch One of her leg hung down so that her foot wa only an inch or two above the snapping teeth Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip then he realised that she wa just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off Peter did not feel very brave indeed he felt he wa going to be sick But that made no difference to what he had to do He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at it side That stroke never reached the Wolf Quick a lightning it turned round it eye flaming and it mouth wide open in a howl of anger If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once As it wa though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword a hard a he could between the brute s foreleg into it heart Then came a horrible confused moment like something in a nightmare He wa tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead and it bared teeth knocked against his forehead and everything wa blood and heat and hair A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and wa straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eye He felt tired all over Then after a bit Susan came down the tree She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won t say there wasn t kissing and cry on both side But in Narnia no one think any the worse of you for that Quick Quick shouted the voice of Aslan Centaurs Eagles I see another wolf in the thicket There behind you He ha just darted away After him all of you He will be going to his mistress Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam And instantly with a thunder of hoof and a beating of wing a dozen or so of the swiftest creature disappeared into the gathering darkness Peter still out of breath turned and saw Aslan close at hand You have forgotten to clean your sword said Aslan It wa true Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf s hair and blood He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass and then wiped it quite dry on his coat Hand it to me and kneel Son of Adam said Aslan And when Peter had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said Rise up Sir Peter Fenris Bane And whatever happens never forget to wipe your sword CHAPTER XIII Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time Now we must go back to Edmund When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir tree and yew tree Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all and not even caring what wa going to happen next provided they would let him lie still He wa too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he wa The Witch and the Dwarf were talking close beside him in low tone No said the Dwarf it is no use now O Queen They must have reached the Stone Table by now Perhaps the Wolf will smell u out and bring u news said the Witch It can not be good news if he doe said the Dwarf Four throne in Cair Paravel said the Witch How if only three were filled That would not fulfil the prophecy What difference would that make now that he is here said the Dwarf He did not dare even now to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress He may not stay long And then we would fall upon the three at Cair Yet it might be better said the Dwarf to keep this one here he kicked Edmund for bargaining with Yes And have him rescued said the Witch scornfully Then said the Dwarf we had better do what we have to do at once I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself said the Witch That is the proper place That is where it ha always been done before It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to it proper use said the Dwarf True said the Witch and then Well I will begin At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them I have seen them They are all at the Stone Table with him They have killed my captain Fenris Ulf I wa hidden in the thicket and saw it all One of the Sons of Adam killed him Fly Fly No said the Witch There need be no flying Go quickly Summon all our people to meet me here a speedily a they can Call out the giant and the werewolf and the spirit of those tree who are on our side Call the Ghouls and the Boggles the Ogres and the Minotaurs Call the Cruels the Hags the Spectres and the people of the Toadstools We will fight What Have I not still my wand Will not their rank turn into stone even a they come on Be off quickly I have a little thing to finish here while you are away The great brute bowed it head turned and galloped away Now said she we have no table let me see We had better put it against the trunk of a tree Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his foot Then the Dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle Her arm were bare underneath it and terribly white Because they were so very white he could not see much else it wa so dark in this valley under the dark tree Prepare the victim said the Witch And the Dwarf undid Edmund s collar and folded back his shirt at the neck Then he took Edmund s hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin After that Edmund heard a strange noise whizz whizz whizz For a moment he couldn t think what it wa Then he realised It wa the sound of a knife being sharpened At that very moment he heard loud shout from every direction a drumming of hoof and a beating of wing a scream from the Witch confusion all round him And then he found he wa being untied Strong arm were round him and he heard big kind voice saying thing like Let him lie down give him some wine drink this steady now you ll be all right in a minute Then he heard the voice of people who were talking not to him but to one another And they were saying thing like Who s got the Witch I thought you had her I didn t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand I wa after the Dwarf Do you mean to say she s escaped A chap can t mind everything at once What s that Oh sorry it s only an old stump But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint Presently the centaur and unicorn and deer and bird they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter all set off to go back to the Stone Table carrying Edmund with them But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone I think they might have been surprised It wa perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree stump and on a fair sized boulder But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there wa something odd about both the stump and the boulder And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the Dwarf For it wa part of her magic that she could make thing look like what they weren t and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife wa knocked out of her hand She had kept hold of her wand also so it had been kept safe too When the other child woke up next morning they had been sleeping on pile of cushion in the pavilion the first thing they heard from Mrs Beaver wa that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night and wa at that moment with Aslan As soon a they had breakfasted they all went out and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass apart from the rest of the court There is no need to tell you and no one ever heard what Aslan wa saying but it wa a conversation which Edmund never forgot As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them bringing Edmund with him Here is your brother he said and there is no need to talk to him about what is past Edmund shook hand with each of the others and said to each of them in turn I m sorry and everyone said That s all right And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friend with him again something ordinary and natural and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopard approached Aslan and said Sire there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience Let him approach said Aslan The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch s Dwarf What is your message Son of Earth asked Aslan The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desire a safe conduct to come and speak with you said the Dwarf on a matter which is a much to your advantage a to hers Queen of Narnia indeed said Mr Beaver Of all the cheek Peace Beaver said Aslan All name will soon be restored to their proper owner In the meantime we will not dispute about noise Tell your mistress Son of Earth that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaf her wand behind her at that great oak This wa agreed to and two leopard went back with the Dwarf to see that the condition were properly carried out But supposing she turn the two leopard into stone whispered Lucy to Peter I think the same idea had occurred to the leopard themselves at any rate a they walked off their fur wa all standing up on their back and their tail were bristling like a cat s when it see a strange dog It ll be all right whispered Peter in reply He wouldn t send them if it weren t A few minute later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan The three child who had not seen her before felt shudder running down their back at the sight of her face and there were low growl among all the animal present Though it wa bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself It wa the oddest thing to see those two face the golden face and the dead white face so close together Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eye Mrs Beaver particularly noticed this You have a traitor there Aslan said the Witch Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he d been through and after the talk he d had that morning He just went on looking at Aslan It didn t seem to matter what the Witch said Well said Aslan His offence wa not against you Have you forgotten the Deep Magic asked the Witch Let u say I have forgotten it answered Aslan gravely Tell u of this Deep Magic Tell you said the Witch her voice growing suddenly shriller Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stand beside u Tell you what is written in letter deep a a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor Beyond the Sea You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning You know that every traitor belongs to me a my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill Oh said Mr Beaver So that s how you came to imagine yourself a Queen because you were the Emperor s hangman I see Peace Beaver said Aslan with a very low growl And so continued the Witch that human creature is mine His life is forfeit to me His blood is my property Come and take it then said the Bull with the man s head in a great bellowing voice Fool said the Witch with a savage smile that wa almost a snarl do you really think your master can rob me of my right by mere force He know the Deep Magic better than that He know that unless I have blood a the Law say all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water It is very true said Aslan I do not deny it Oh Aslan whispered Susan in the Lion s ear can t we I mean you won t will you Can t we do something about the Deep Magic Isn t there something you can work against it Work against the Emperor s magic said Aslan turning to her with something like a frown on his face And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again Edmund wa on the other side of Aslan looking all the time at Aslan s face He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something but a moment later he felt that he wa not expected to do anything except to wait and do what he wa told Fall back all of you said Aslan and I will talk to the Witch alone They all obeyed It wa a terrible time this waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voice Lucy said Oh Edmund and began to cry Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea The Beavers stood holding each other s paw with their head bowed The centaur stamped uneasily with their hoof But everyone became perfectly still in the end so that you noticed even small sound like a bumble bee flying past or the bird in the forest down below them or the wind rustling the leaf And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on At last they heard Aslan s voice You can all come back he said I have settled the matter She ha renounced the claim on your brother s blood And all over the hill there wa a noise a if everyone had been holding his breath and had now begun breathing again and then a murmur of talk They began to come back to Aslan s throne The Witch wa just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said But how do I know this promise will be kept Wow roared Aslan half rising from his throne and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder and the Witch after staring for a moment with her lip wide apart picked up her skirt and fairly ran for her life CHAPTER XIV The Triumph of the Witch As soon a the Witch had gone Aslan said We must move from this place at once it will be wanted for other purpose We shall encamp to night at the Fords of Beruna Of course everyone wa dying to ask him how he had arranged matter with the Witch but his face wa stern and everyone s ear were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared After a meal which wa taken in the open air on the hill top for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing thing up Before two o clock they were on the march and set off in a North Westerly direction walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign As soon a she ha finished her business in these part he said the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it He then went on to outline two plan of battle one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle And all the time he wa advising Peter how to conduct the operation saying thing like You must put your centaur in such and such a place or You must post scout to see that she doesn t do so and so till at last Peter said But you will be there yourself Aslan I can give you no promise of that answered the Lion And he continued giving Peter his instruction For the last part of the journey it wa Susan and Lucy who saw most of him He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad It wa still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river wa broad and shallow This wa the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave order to halt on this side of the water But Peter said Wouldn t it be better to camp on the far side for fear she should try a night attack or anything Aslan who seemed to have been thinking about something else roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said Eh What s that Peter said it all over again No said Aslan in a dull voice a if it didn t matter No She will not make an attack to night And then he sighed deeply But presently he added All the same it wa well thought of That is how a soldier ought to think But it doesn t really matter So they proceeded to pitch their camp Aslan s mood affected everyone that evening Peter wa feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own the news that Aslan might not be there had come a a great shock to him Supper that evening wa a quiet meal Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning It wa a if the good time having just begun were already drawing to their end This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn t get to sleep when she went to bed And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness Can t you get to sleep either said Susan No said Lucy I thought you were asleep I say Susan What I ve a most horrible feeling a if something were hanging over u Have you Because a a matter of fact so have I Something about Aslan said Lucy Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him or something dreadful that he s going to do There s been something wrong with him all afternoon said Susan Lucy What wa that he said about not being with u at the battle You don t think he could be stealing away and leaving u to night do you Where is he now said Lucy Is he here in the pavilion I don t think so Susan Let s go outside and have a look round We might see him All right Let s said Susan we might just a well be doing that a lying awake here Very quietly the two girl groped their way among the other sleeper and crept out of the tent The moonlight wa bright and everything wa quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stone Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy s arm and said Look On the far side of the camping ground just where the tree began they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood Without a word they both followed him He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the left apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table On and on he led them into dark shadow and out into pale moonlight getting their foot wet with the heavy dew He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly a if he were very very tired Then when they were crossing a wide open place where there were no shadow for them to hide in he stopped and looked round It wa no good trying to run away so they came towards him When they were closer he said Oh child child why are you following me We couldn t sleep said Lucy and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking Please may we come with you wherever you re going said Susan Well said Aslan and seemed to be thinking Then he said I should be glad of company to night Yes you may come if you will promise to stop when I tell you and after that leave me to go on alone Oh thank you thank you And we will said the two girl Forward they went again and one of the girl walked on each side of the Lion But how slowly he walked And his great royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan Aslan Dear Aslan said Lucy what is wrong Can t you tell u Are you ill dear Aslan asked Susan No said Aslan I am sad and lonely Lay your hand on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let u walk like that And so the girl did what they would never have dared to do without his permission but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him buried their cold hand in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and so doing walked with him And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood They went up at the side where the tree came furthest up and when they got to the last tree it wa one that had some bush about it Aslan stopped and said Oh child child Here you must stop And whatever happens do not let yourselves be seen Farewell And both the girl cried bitterly though they hardly knew why and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paw and his great sad eye Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill And Lucy and Susan crouching in the bush looked after him and this is what they saw A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon wa shining many of them carried torch which burned with evil looking red flame and black smoke But such people Ogres with monstrous teeth and wolf and bull headed men spirit of evil tree and poisonous plant and other creature whom I won t describe because if I did the grown ups would probably not let you read this book Cruels and Hags and Incubuses Wraiths Horrors Efreets Sprites Orknies Wooses and Ettins In fact here were all those who were on the Witch s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command And right in the middle standing by the Table wa the Witch herself A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creature when they first saw the great Lion pacing towards them and for a moment the Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear Then she recovered herself and gave a wild fierce laugh The fool she cried The fool ha come Bind him fast Lucy and Susan held their breath waiting for Aslan s roar and his spring upon his enemy But it never came Four hag grinning and leering yet also at first hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do had approached him Bind him I say repeated the White Witch The hag made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all Then others evil dwarf and ape rushed in to help them and between them they rolled the huge Lion round on his back and tied all his four paw together shouting and cheering a if they had done something brave though had the Lion chosen one of those paw could have been the death of them all But he made no noise even when the enemy straining and tugging pulled the cord so tight that they cut into his flesh Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table Stop said the Witch Let him first be shaved Another roar of mean laughter went up from her follower a an ogre with a pair of shear came forward and squatted down by Aslan s head Snip snip snip went the shear and mass of curling gold began to fall to the ground Then the ogre stood back and the child watching from their hiding place could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without it mane The enemy also saw the difference Why he s only a great cat after all cried one Is that what we were afraid of said another And they surged round Aslan jeering at him saying thing like Puss Puss Poor Pussy and How many mouse have you caught to day Cat and Would you like a saucer of milk Pussums Oh how can they said Lucy tear streaming down her cheek The brute the brute for now that the first shock wa over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver and more beautiful and more patient than ever Muzzle him said the Witch And even now a they worked about his face putting on the muzzle one bite from his jaw would have cost two or three of them their hand But he never moved And this seemed to enrage all that rabble Everyone wa at him now Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he wa bound began to find their courage and for a few minute the two girl could not even see him so thickly wa he surrounded by the whole crowd of creature kicking him hitting him spitting on him jeering at him At last the rabble had had enough of this They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table some pulling and some pushing He wa so huge that even when they got him there it took all their effort to hoist him onto the surface of it Then there wa more tying and tightening of cord The coward The coward sobbed Susan Are they still afraid of him even now When once Aslan had been tied and tied so that he wa really a mass of cord on the flat stone a hush fell on the crowd Four Hags holding four torch stood at the corner of the Table The Witch bared her arm a she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan Then she began to whet her knife It looked to the child when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it a if the knife were made of stone not of steel and it wa of a strange and evil shape At last she drew near She stood by Aslan s head Her face wa working and twitching with passion but his looked up at the sky still quiet neither angry nor afraid but a little sad Then just before she gave the blow she stooped down and said in a quivering voice And now who ha won Fool did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor Now I will kill you instead of him a our pact wa and so the Deep Magic will be appeased But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him a well And who will take him out of my hand then Understand that you have given me Narnia forever you have lost your own life and you have not saved his In that knowledge despair and die The child did not see the actual moment of the killing They couldn t bear to look and had covered their eye CHAPTER XV Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time While the two girl still crouched in the bush with their hand over their face they heard the voice of the Witch calling out Now Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war It will not take u long to crush the human vermin and the traitor now that the great Fool the great Cat lie dead At this moment the child were for a few second in very great danger For with wild cry and a noise of skirling pipe and shrill horn blowing the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill top and down the slope right past their hiding place They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping foot of the Minotaurs and overhead there went a flurry of foul wing and a blackness of vulture and giant bat At any other time they would have trembled with fear but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan s death so filled their mind that they hardly thought of it As soon a the wood wa silent again Susan and Lucy crept out into the open hill top The moon wa getting low and thin cloud were passing across her but still they could see the shape of the great Lion lying dead in his bond And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur what wa left of it and cried till they could cry no more And then they looked at each other and held each other s hand for mere loneliness and cried again and then again were silent At last Lucy said I can t bear the look of that horrible muzzle I wonder could we take it off So they tried And after a lot of working at it for their finger were cold and it wa now the darkest part of the night they succeeded And when they saw his face without it they burst out cry again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam a well a they could And it wa all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe I wonder could we untie him a well said Susan presently But the enemy out of pure spitefulness had drawn the cord so tight that the girl could make nothing of the knot I hope no one who read this book ha been quite a miserable a Susan and Lucy were that night but if you have been if you ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tear left in you you will know that there come in the end a sort of quietness You feel a if nothing wa ever going to happen again At any rate that wa how it felt to these two Hours and hour seemed to go by in this dead calm and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder But at last Lucy noticed two other thing One wa that the sky on the East side of the hill wa a little le dark than it had been an hour ago The other wa some tiny movement going on in the grass at her foot At first she took no interest in this What did it matter Nothing mattered now But at last she saw that whatever it wa had begun to move up the upright stone of the Stone Table And now whatever they were were moving about on Aslan s body She peered closer They were little grey thing Ugh said Susan from the other side of the Table How beastly There are horrid little mouse crawling over him Go away you little beast And she raised her hand to frighten them away Wait said Lucy who had been looking at them more closely still Can you see what they re doing Both girl bent down and stared I do believe said Susan But how queer They re nibbling away at the cord That s what I thought said Lucy I think they re friendly mouse Poor little thing they don t realise he s dead They think it ll do some good untying him It wa quite definitely lighter by now Each of the girl noticed for the first time the white face of the other They could see the mouse nibbling away dozen and dozen even hundred of little field mouse And at last one by one the rope were all gnawed through The sky in the East wa whitish by now and the star were getting fainter all except one very big one low down on the Eastern horizon They felt colder than they had been all night The mouse crept away again The girl cleared away the remains of the gnawed rope Aslan looked more like himself without them Every moment his dead face looked nobler a the light grew and they could see it better In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound It had been so still for hour and hour that it startled them Then another bird answered it Soon there were bird singing all over the place It wa quite definitely early morning now not late night I m so cold said Lucy So am I said Susan Let s walk about a bit They walked to the Eastern edge of the hill and looked down The one big star had almost disappeared The country all looked dark grey but beyond at the very end of the world the sea showed pale The sky began to turn red They walked to and fro more time than they could count between the dead Aslan and the Eastern ridge trying to keep warm and oh how tired their leg felt Then at last a they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel which they could now just make out the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise a great cracking deafening noise a if a giant had broken a giant s plate What s that said Lucy clutching Susan s arm I I feel afraid to turn round said Susan something awful is happening They re doing something worse to him said Lucy Come on And she turned pulling Susan round with her The rising of the sun had made everything look so different all the colour and shadow were changed that for a moment they didn t see the important thing Then they did The Stone Table wa broken into two piece by a great crack that ran down it from end to end and there wa no Aslan Oh oh oh cried the two girl rushing back to the Table Oh it s too bad sobbed Lucy they might have left the body alone Who s done it cried Susan What doe it mean Is it more magic Yes said a great voice behind their back It is more magic They looked round There shining in the sunrise larger than they had seen him before shaking his mane for it had apparently grown again stood Aslan himself Oh Aslan cried both the child staring up at him almost a much frightened a they were glad Aren t you dead then dear Aslan said Lucy Not now said Aslan You re not not a asked Susan in a shaky voice She couldn t bring herself to say the word ghost Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her Do I look it he said Oh you re real you re real Oh Aslan cried Lucy and both girl flung themselves upon him and covered him with kiss But what doe it all mean asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer It mean said Aslan that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic there is a magic deeper still which she did not know Her knowledge go back only to the dawn of Time But if she could have looked a little further back into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned she would have read there a different incantation She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery wa killed in a traitor s stead the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards And now Oh yes Now said Lucy jumping up and clapping her hand Oh child said the Lion I feel my strength coming back to me Oh child catch me if you can He stood for a second his eye very bright his limb quivering lashing himself with his tail Then he made a leap high over their head and landed on the other side of the Table Laughing though she didn t know why Lucy scrambled over it to reach him Aslan leaped again A mad chase began Round and round the hill top he led them now hopelessly out of their reach now letting them almost catch his tail now diving between them now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paw and catching them again and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arm and leg It wa such a romp a no one ha ever had except in Narnia and whether it wa more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind And the funny thing wa that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girl no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty And now said Aslan presently to business I feel I am going to roar You had better put your finger in your ear And they did And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it And they saw all the tree in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring a grass bend in a meadow before the wind Then he said We have a long journey to go You must ride on me And he crouched down and the child climbed onto his warm golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off faster than any horse could go downhill and into the thick of the forest That ride wa perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia Have you ever had a gallop on a horse Think of that and then take away the heavy noise of the hoof and the jingle of the harness and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paw Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur and the mane flying back in the wind And then imagine you are going about twice a fast a the fastest racehorse But this is a mount that doesn t need to be guided and never grows tired He rush on and on never missing his footing never hesitating threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunk jumping over bush and briar and the smaller stream wading the larger swimming the largest of all And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the down but right across Narnia in spring down solemn avenue of beech and across sunny glade of oak through wild orchard of snow white cherry tree past roaring waterfall and mossy rock and echoing cavern up windy slope alight with gorse bush and across the shoulder of heathery mountain and along giddy ridge and down down down again into wild valley and out into acre of blue flower It wa nearly mid day when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle a little toy castle it looked from where they stood which seemed to be all pointed tower But the Lion wa rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it wa they were already on a level with it And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them No face looked over the battlement and the gate were fast shut And Aslan not at all slacking his pace rushed straight a a bullet towards it The Witch s home he cried Now child hold tight Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down and the child felt a if they had left their inside behind them for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped or you may call it flying rather than jumping right over the castle wall The two girl breathless but unhurt found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statue CHAPTER XVI What Happened about the Statues What an extraordinary place cried Lucy All those stone animal and people too It s it s like a museum Hush said Susan Aslan s doing something He wa indeed He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him Then without waiting a moment he whisked round almost a if he had been a cat chasing it tail and breathed also on the stone dwarf which a you remember wa standing a few foot from the lion with his back to it Then he pounced on a tall stone Dryad which stood beyond the dwarf turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right and rushed on to two centaur But at that moment Lucy said Oh Susan Look Look at the lion I expect you ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire And for a second nothing seems to have happened and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper It wa like that now For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back then it spread then the colour seemed to lick all over him a the flame lick all over a bit of paper then while his hind quarter were still obviously stone the lion shook his mane and all the heavy stony fold rippled into living hair Then he opened a great red mouth warm and living and gave a prodigious yawn And now his hind leg had come to life He lifted one of them and scratched himself Then having caught sight of Aslan he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face Of course the child s eye turned to follow the lion but the sight they saw wa so wonderful that they soon forgot about him Everywhere the statue were coming to life The courtyard looked no longer like a museum it looked more like a zoo Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he wa almost hidden in the crowd Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard wa now a blaze of colour glossy chestnut side of centaur indigo horn of unicorn dazzling plumage of bird reddy brown of fox dog and satyr yellow stocking and crimson hood of dwarf and the birch girl in silver and the beech girl in fresh transparent green and the larch girl in green so bright that it wa almost yellow And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roaring brayings yelping barkings squealings cooings neighings stampings shout hurrah song and laughter Ooh said Susan in a different tone Look I wonder I mean is it safe Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the foot of the stone giant It s all right shouted Aslan joyously Once the foot are put right all the rest of him will follow That wasn t exactly what I meant whispered Susan to Lucy But it wa too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her The change wa already creeping up the Giant s leg Now he wa moving his foot A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder rubbed his eye and said Bless me I must have been asleep Now Where s that dratted little Witch that wa running about on the ground Somewhere just by my foot it wa But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood then he bowed down till his head wa no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan beaming all over his honest ugly face giant of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giant are good tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming It s a sight well worth looking at Now for the inside of this house said Aslan Look alive everyone Up stair and down stair and in my lady s chamber Leave no corner unsearched You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed And into the interior they all rushed and for several minute the whole of that dark horrible fusty old castle echoed with the opening of window and with everyone s voice cry out at once Don t forget the dungeon Give u a hand with this door Here s another little winding stair Oh I say Here s a poor little kangaroo Call Aslan Phew How it smell in here Look out for trap door Up here There are a whole lot more on the landing But the best of all wa when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out Aslan Aslan I ve found Mr Tumnus Oh do come quick A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding one another by both hand and dancing round and round for joy The little chap wa none the worse for having been a statue and wa of course very interested in all she had to tell him But at last the ransacking of the Witch s fortress wa ended The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil place which needed them so badly The whole crowd of liberated statue surged back into the courtyard And it wa then that someone Tumnus I think first said But how are we going to get out for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gate were still locked That ll be all right said Aslan and then rising on his hind leg he bawled up at the Giant Hi You up there he roared What s your name Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour said the Giant once more touching his cap Well then Giant Rumblebuffin said Aslan just let u out of this will you Certainly your honour It will be a pleasure said Giant Rumblebuffin Stand well away from the gate all you little un Then he strode to the gate himself and bang bang bang went his huge club The gate creaked at the first blow cracked at the second and shivered at the third Then he tackled the tower on each side of them and after a few minute of crashing and thudding both the tower and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble and when the dust cleared it wa odd standing in that dry grim stony yard to see through the gap all the grass and waving tree and sparkling stream of the forest and the blue hill beyond that and beyond them the sky Blowed if I ain t all in a muck sweat said the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine Comes of being out of condition I suppose neither of you young lady ha such a thing a a pocket handkerchee about you Yes I have said Lucy standing on tip toe and holding her handkerchief up a far a she could reach Thank you Missie said Giant Rumblebuffin stooping down Next moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid air between the Giant s finger and thumb But just a she wa getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering Bless me I ve picked up the little girl instead I beg your pardon Missie I thought you wa the handkerchee No no said Lucy laughing here it is This time he managed to get it but it wa only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face she said I m afraid it s not much use to you Mr Rumblebuffin Not at all Not at all said the Giant politely Never met a nicer handkerchee So fine so handy So I don t know how to describe it What a nice giant he is said Lucy to Mr Tumnus Oh yes replied the Faun All the Buffins always were One of the most respected of all the giant family in Narnia Not very clever perhaps I never knew a giant that wa but an old family With tradition you know If he d been the other sort she d never have turned him into stone At this point Aslan clapped his paw together and called for silence Our day s work is not yet over he said and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed time we must find the battle at once And join in I hope Sir added the largest of the centaur Of course said Aslan And now Those who can t keep up that is child dwarf and small animal must ride on the back of those who can that is lion centaur unicorn horse giant and eagle Those who are good with their nose must come in the front with u lion to smell out where the battle is Look lively and sort yourselves And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did The most pleased of the lot wa the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met Did you hear what he said Us lion That mean him and me Us lion That s what I like about Aslan No side no stand off ishness Us lion That meant him and me At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarf one Dryad two rabbit and a hedgehog That steadied him a bit When all were ready it wa a big sheep dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order they set out through the gap in the castle wall At first the lion and dog went nosing about in all direction But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay There wa no time lost after that Soon all the dog and lion and wolf and other hunting animal were going at full speed with their nose to the ground and all the others streaked out for about half a mile behind them were following a fast a they could The noise wa like an English fox hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hound wa mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself Faster and faster they went a the scent became easier and easier to follow And then just a they came to the last curve in a narrow winding valley Lucy heard above all these noise another noise a different one which gave her a queer feeling inside It wa a noise of shout and shriek and of the clashing of metal against metal Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan s army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creature whom she had seen last night only now in the daylight they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed There also seemed to be far more of them Aslan s army which had their back to her looked terribly few And there were statue dotted all over the battlefield so apparently the Witch had been using her wand But she did not seem to be using it now She wa fighting with her stone knife It wa Peter she wa fighting both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what wa happening she only saw the stone knife and Peter s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knife and three sword That pair were in the centre On each side the line stretched out Horrible thing were happening wherever she looked Off my back child shouted Aslan And they both tumbled off Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the Western lamp post to the shore of the Eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath and at the same moment all war like creature whom Aslan had led from the Witch s house rushed madly on the enemy s line dwarf with their battle ax dog with teeth the giant with his club and his foot also crushed dozen of the foe unicorn with their horn centaur with sword and hoof And Peter s tired army cheered and the newcomer roared and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re echoed with the din of that onset CHAPTER XVII The Hunting of the White Stag The battle wa all over a few minute after their arrival Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his companion and when those who were still living saw that the Witch wa dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight The next thing that Lucy knew wa that Peter and Aslan were shaking hand It wa strange to her to see Peter looking a he looked now his face wa so pale and stern and he seemed so much older It wa all Edmund s doing Aslan Peter wa saying We d have been beaten if it hadn t been for him The Witch wa turning our troop into stone right and left But nothing would stop him He fought his way through three ogre to where she wa just turning one of your leopard into a statue And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pain That wa the mistake all the rest were making Once her wand wa broken we began to have some chance if we hadn t lost so many already He wa terribly wounded We must go and see him They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from the fighting line He wa covered with blood his mouth wa open and his face a nasty green colour Quick Lucy said Aslan And then almost for the first time Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present Her hand trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper but she managed it in the end and poured a few drop into her brother s mouth There are other people wounded said Aslan while she wa still looking eagerly into Edmund s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result Yes I know said Lucy crossly Wait a minute Daughter of Eve said Aslan in a graver voice others also are at the point of death Must more people die for Edmund I m sorry Aslan said Lucy getting up and going with him And for the next half hour they were busy she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone When at last she wa free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his foot and not only healed of his wound but looking better than she had seen him look oh for age in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which wa where he had begun to go wrong He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a Knight Does he know whispered Lucy to Susan what Aslan did for him Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really wa Hush No Of course not said Susan Oughtn t he to be told said Lucy Oh surely not said Susan It would be too awful for him Think how you d feel if you were he All the same I think he ought to know said Lucy But at that moment they were interrupted That night they slept where they were How Aslan provided food for them all I don t know but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o clock Next day they began marching Eastward down the side of the great river And the next day after that at about tea time they actually reached the mouth The castle of Cair Paravel on it little hill towered up above them before them were the sand with rock and little pool of salt water and sea weed and the smell of the sea and long mile of bluish green wave breaking forever and ever on the beach And oh the cry of the sea gull Have you heard it Can you remember That evening after tea the four child all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoe and stocking off and feel the sand between their toe But next day wa more solemn For then in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west door all hung with peacock s feather and the eastern door which open right onto the sea in the presence of all their friend and to the sound of trumpet Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them onto the four throne amid deafening shout of Long Live King Peter Long Live Queen Susan Long Live King Edmund Long Live Queen Lucy Once a king or queen in Narnia always a king or queen Bear it well Sons of Adam Bear it well Daughters of Eve said Aslan And through the Eastern door which wa wide open came the voice of the merman and the mermaid swimming close to the castle step and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens So the child sat in their throne and sceptre were put into their hand and they gave reward and honour to all their friend to Tumnus the Faun and to the Beavers and Giant Rumblebuffin to the leopard and the good centaur and the good dwarf and to the lion And that night there wa a great feast in Cair Paravel and revelry and dancing and gold flashed and wine flowed and answering to the music inside but stranger sweeter and more piercing came the music of the sea people But amidst all these rejoicing Aslan himself quietly slipped away And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn t there they said nothing about it For Mr Beaver had warned them He ll be coming and going he had said One day you ll see him and another you won t He doesn t like being tied down and of course he ha other country to attend to It s quite all right He ll often drop in Only you mustn t press him He s wild you know Not like a tame lion And now a you see this story is nearly but not quite at an end These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well and long and happy wa their reign At first much of their time wa spent in seeking out the remnant of the White Witch s army and destroying them and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil thing lurking in the wilder part of the forest a haunting here and a killing there a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next But in the end all that foul brood wa stamped out And they made good law and kept the peace and saved good tree from being unnecessarily cut down and liberated young dwarf and young satyr from being sent to school and generally stopped busybody and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live And they drove back the fierce giant quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin on the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier And they entered into friendship and alliance with country beyond the sea and paid them visit of state and received visit of state from them And they themselves grew and changed a the year passed over them And Peter became a tall and deep chested man and a great warrior and he wa called King Peter the Magnificent And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her foot and the Kings of the country beyond the sea began to send ambassador asking for her hand in marriage And she wa called Queen Susan the Gentle Edmund wa a graver and quieter man than Peter and great in council and judgement He wa called King Edmund the Just But a for Lucy she wa always gay and golden haired and all Princes in those part desired her to be their Queen and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it wa only a one remembers a dream And one year it fell out that Tumnus who wa a middle aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his part the White Stag who would give you wish if you caught him So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal member of their court rode a hunting with horn and hound in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin till the horse of all the courtier were tired out and only these four were still following And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horse could not follow Then said King Peter for they talked in quite a different style now having been Kings and Queens for so long Fair Consorts let u now alight from our horse and follow this beast into the thicket for in all my day I never hunted a nobler quarry Sir said the others even so let u do So they alighted and tied their horse to tree and went on into the thick wood on foot And a soon a they had entered it Queen Susan said Fair friend here is a great marvel for I seem to see a tree of iron Madam said King Edmund if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof Marry a strange device said King Peter to set a lantern here where the tree cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man Sir said Queen Lucy By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller tree in the place or fewer or none For this is a young wood and the iron post is old And they stood looking upon it Then said King Edmund I know not how it is but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely It run in my mind that I have seen the like before a it were in a dream or in the dream of a dream Sir answered they all it is even so with u also And more said Queen Lucy for it will not go out of my mind that if we pas this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventure or else some great change of our fortune Madam said King Edmund the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also And in mine fair brother said King Peter And in mine too said Queen Susan Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horse and follow this White Stag no further Madam said King Peter therein I pray thee to have me excused For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hand to any high matter a battle quest feat of arm act of justice and the like and then given over but always what we have taken in hand the same we have achieved Sister said Queen Lucy my royal brother speaks rightly And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast a now we have in chase And so say I said King Edmund And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the island Then in the name of Aslan said Queen Susan if ye will all have it so let u go on and take the adventure that shall fall to u So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket and before they had gone a score of pace they all remembered that the thing they had seen wa called a lamp post and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that they were making their way not through branch but through coat And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes It wa the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide Mrs Macready and the visitor were still talking in the passage but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the child weren t caught And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coat out of his wardrobe were missing And the Professor who wa a very remarkable man didn t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lie but believed the whole story No he said I don t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coat You won t get into Narnia again by that route Nor would the coat be much use by now if you did Eh What s that Yes of course you ll get back to Narnia again some day Once a King in Narnia always a King in Narnia But don t go trying to use the same route twice Indeed don t try to get there at all It ll happen when you re not looking for it And don t talk too much about it even among yourselves And don t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they ve had adventure of the same sort themselves What s that How will you know Oh you ll know all right Odd thing they say even their look will let the secret out Keep your eye open Bless me what do they teach them at these school And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe But if the Professor wa right it wa only the beginning of the adventure of Narnia The End'"

    "‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ has a volume of close to 40K words. Lewis used 3000 different distinct words to tell his story in the first book, leading to a variability of around 8%. Variability is in this case calculated as the distinct words divided by the total words in the text, also known as Type-Text Ratio (TTR). It is one of many different measures of the complexity of the text, the richness of the vocabulary and to what degree repetitions are avoided"
