CHAPTER I Lucy Looks into a Wardrobe Once there were four child whose name were Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air raid They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country ten mile from the nearest railway station and two mile from the nearest post office He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three servant Their name were Ivy Margaret and Betty but they do not come into the story much He himself wa a very old man with shaggy white hair which grew over most of his face a well a on his head and they liked him almost at once but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he wa so odd looking that Lucy who wa the youngest wa a little afraid of him and Edmund who wa the next youngest wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he wa blowing his nose to hide it As soon a they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night the boy came into the girl room and they all talked it over We ve fallen on our foot and no mistake said Peter This is going to be perfectly splendid That old chap will let u do anything we like I think he s an old dear said Susan Oh come off it said Edmund who wa tired and pretending not to be tired which always made him bad tempered Don t go on talking like that Like what said Susan and anyway it s time you were in bed Trying to talk like Mother said Edmund And who are you to say when I m to go to bed Go to bed yourself Hadn t we all better go to bed said Lucy There s sure to be a row if we re heard talking here No there won t said Peter I tell you this is the sort of house where no one s going to mind what we do Anyway they won t hear u It s about ten minute walk from here down to that dining room and any amount of stair and passage in between What s that noise said Lucy suddenly It wa a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passage and row of door leading into empty room wa beginning to make her feel a little creepy It s only a bird silly said Edmund It s an owl said Peter This is going to be a wonderful place for bird I shall go to bed now I say let s go and explore to morrow You might find anything in a place like this Did you see those mountain a we came along And the wood There might be eagle There might be stag There ll be hawk Badgers said Lucy Snakes said Edmund Foxes said Susan But when next morning came there wa a steady rain falling so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountain nor the wood nor even the stream in the garden Of course it would be raining said Edmund They had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them a long low room with two window looking out in one direction and two in another Do stop grumbling Ed said Susan Ten to one it ll clear up in an hour or so And in the meantime we re pretty well off There s a wireless and lot of book Not for me said Peter I m going to explore in the house Everyone agreed to this and that wa how the adventure began It wa the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of and it wa full of unexpected place The first few door they tried led only into spare bedroom a everyone had expected that they would but soon they came to a very long room full of picture and there they found a suit of armour and after that wa a room all hung with green with a harp in one corner and then came three step down and five step up and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony and then a whole series of room that led into each other and were lined with book most of them very old book and some bigger than a Bible in a church And shortly after that they looked into a room that wa quite empty except for one big wardrobe the sort that ha a looking glass in the door There wa nothing else in the room at all except a dead blue bottle on the window sill Nothing there said Peter and they all trooped out again all except Lucy She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked To her surprise it opened quite easily and two moth ball dropped out Looking into the inside she saw several coat hanging up mostly long fur coat There wa nothing Lucy liked so much a the smell and feel of fur She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coat and rubbed her face against them leaving the door open of course because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe Soon she went further in and found that there wa a second row of coat hanging up behind the first one It wa almost quite dark in there and she kept her arm stretched out in front of her so a not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe She took a step further in then two or three step always expecting to feel woodwork against the tip of her finger But she could not feel it This must be a simply enormous wardrobe thought Lucy going still further in and pushing the soft fold of the coat aside to make room for her Then she noticed that there wa something crunching under her foot I wonder is that more moth ball she thought stooping down to feel it with her hand But instead of feeling the hard smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold This is very queer she said and went on a step or two further Next moment she found that what wa rubbing against her face and hand wa no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly Why it is just like branch of tree exclaimed Lucy And then she saw that there wa a light ahead of her not a few inch away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been but a long way off Something cold and soft wa falling on her A moment later she found that she wa standing in the middle of a wood at night time with snow under her foot and snowflake falling through the air Lucy felt a little frightened but she felt very inquisitive and excited a well She looked back over her shoulder and there between the dark tree trunk she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out She had of course left the door open for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe It seemed to be still daylight there I can always get back if anything go wrong thought Lucy She began to walk forward crunch crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light In about ten minute she reached it and found that it wa a lamp post As she stood looking at it wondering why there wa a lamp post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next she heard a pitter patter of foot coming towards her And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the tree into the light of the lamp post He wa only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella white with snow From the waist upwards he wa like a man but his leg were shaped like a goat s the hair on them wa glossy black and instead of foot he had goat s hoof He also had a tail but Lucy did not notice this at first because it wa neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so a to keep it from trailing in the snow He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin wa rather reddish too He had a strange but pleasant little face with a short pointed beard and curly hair and out of the hair there stuck two horn one on each side of his forehead One of his hand a I have said held the umbrella in the other arm he carried several brown paper parcel What with the parcel and the snow it looked just a if he had been doing his Christmas shopping He wa a Faun And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcel Goodness gracious me exclaimed the Faun CHAPTER II What Lucy Found There Good evening said Lucy But the Faun wa so busy picking up his parcel that at first he did not reply When he had finished he made her a little bow Good evening good evening said the Faun Excuse me I don t want to be inquisitive but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve My name s Lucy said she not quite understanding him But you are forgive me you are what they call a girl asked the Faun Of course I m a girl said Lucy You are in fact Human Of course I m human said Lucy still a little puzzled To be sure to be sure said the Faun How stupid of me But I ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before I am delighted That is to say and then he stopped a if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time Delighted delighted he went on Allow me to introduce myself My name is Tumnus I am very pleased to meet you Mr Tumnus said Lucy And may I ask O Lucy Daughter of Eve said Mr Tumnus how you have come into Narnia Narnia What s that said Lucy This is the land of Narnia said the Faun where we are now all that lie between the lamp post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea And you you have come from the wild wood of the west I I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room said Lucy Ah said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice if only I had worked harder at geography when I wa a little Faun I should no doubt know all about those strange country It is too late now But they aren t country at all said Lucy almost laughing It s only just back there at least I m not sure It is summer there Meanwhile said Mr Tumnus it is winter in Narnia and ha been for ever so long and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reign around the bright city of War Drobe how would it be if you came and had tea with me Thank you very much Mr Tumnus said Lucy But I wa wondering whether I ought to be getting back It s only just round the corner said the Faun and there ll be a roaring fire and toast and sardine and cake Well it s very kind of you said Lucy But I shan t be able to stay long If you will take my arm Daughter of Eve said Mr Tumnus I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of u That s the way Now off we go And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature a if they had known one another all their life They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rock all about and little hill up and little hill down At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenly aside a if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock but at the last moment Lucy found he wa leading her into the entrance of a cave As soon a they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs and lit a lamp Now we shan t be long he said and immediately put a kettle on Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place It wa a little dry clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chair one for me and one for a friend said Mr Tumnus and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard In one corner there wa a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus bedroom and on one wall wa a shelf full of book Lucy looked at these while he wa setting out the tea thing They had title like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men Monks and Gamekeepers a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth Now Daughter of Eve said the Faun And really it wa a wonderful tea There wa a nice brown egg lightly boiled for each of them and then sardine on toast and then buttered toast and then toast with honey and then a sugar topped cake And when Lucy wa tired of eating the Faun began to talk He had wonderful tale to tell of life in the forest He told about the midnight dance and how the Nymphs who lived in the well and the Dryads who lived in the tree came out to dance with the Fauns about long hunting party after the milk white Stag who could give you wish if you caught him about feasting and treasure seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mine and cavern far beneath the forest floor and then about summer when the wood were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them and sometimes Bacchus himself and then the stream would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for week on end Not that it isn t always winter now he added gloomily Then to cheer himself up he took out from it case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked a if it were made of straw and began to play And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time It must have been hour later when she shook herself and said Oh Mr Tumnus I m so sorry to stop you and I do love that tune but really I must go home I only meant to stay for a few minute It s no good now you know said the Faun laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully No good said Lucy jumping up and feeling rather frightened What do you mean I ve got to go home at once The others will be wondering what ha happened to me But a moment later she asked Mr Tumnus Whatever is the matter for the Faun s brown eye had filled with tear and then the tear began trickling down his cheek and soon they were running off the end of his nose and at last he covered his face with his hand and began to howl Mr Tumnus Mr Tumnus said Lucy in great distress Don t Don t What is the matter Aren t you well Dear Mr Tumnus do tell me what is wrong But the Faun continued sobbing a if his heart would break And even when Lucy went over and put her arm round him and lent him her handkerchief he did not stop He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it wringing it out with both hand whenever it got too wet to be any more use so that presently Lucy wa standing in a damp patch Mr Tumnus bawled Lucy in his ear shaking him Do stop Stop it at once You ought to be ashamed of yourself a great big Faun like you What on earth are you cry about Oh oh oh sobbed Mr Tumnus I m cry because I m such a bad Faun I don t think you re a bad Faun at all said Lucy I think you are a very good Faun You are the nicest Faun I ve ever met Oh oh you wouldn t say that if you knew replied Mr Tumnus between his sob No I m a bad Faun I don t suppose there ever wa a worse Faun since the beginning of the world But what have you done asked Lucy My old father now said Mr Tumnus that s his picture over the mantelpiece He would never have done a thing like this A thing like what said Lucy Like what I ve done said the Faun Taken service under the White Witch That s what I am I m in the pay of the White Witch The White Witch Who is she Why it is she that ha got all Narnia under her thumb It s she that make it always winter Always winter and never Christmas think of that How awful said Lucy But what doe she pay you for That s the worst of it said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan I m a kidnapper for her that s what I am Look at me Daughter of Eve Would you believe that I m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood one that had never done me any harm and pretend to be friendly with it and invite it home to my cave all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch No said Lucy I m sure you wouldn t do anything of the sort But I have said the Faun Well said Lucy rather slowly for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him well that wa pretty bad But you re so sorry for it that I m sure you will never do it again Daughter of Eve don t you understand said the Faun It isn t something I have done I m doing it now this very moment What do you mean cried Lucy turning very white You are the child said Mr Tumnus I had order from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood I wa to catch them and hand them over to her And you are the first I ever met And I ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea and all the time I ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell her Oh but you won t Mr Tumnus said Lucy You won t will you Indeed indeed you really mustn t And if I don t said he beginning to cry again she s sure to find out And she ll have my tail cut off and my horn sawn off and my beard plucked out and she ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoof and turn them into horrid solid hoof like a wretched horse s And if she is extra and specially angry she ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four throne at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness know when that will happen or whether it will ever happen at all I m very sorry Mr Tumnus said Lucy But please let me go home Of course I will said the Faun Of course I ve got to I see that now I hadn t known what Humans were like before I met you Of course I can t give you up to the Witch not now that I know you But we must be off at once I ll see you back to the lamp post I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe I m sure I can said Lucy We must go a quietly a we can said Mr Tumnus The whole wood is full of her spy Even some of the tree are on her side They both got up and left the tea thing on the table and Mr Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm and they went out into the snow The journey back wa not at all like the journey to the Faun s cave they stole along a quickly a they could without speaking a word and Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest place Lucy wa relieved when they reached the lamp post again Do you know your way from here Daughter of Eve said Tumnus Lucy looked very hard between the tree and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight Yes she said I can see the wardrobe door Then be off home a quick a you can said the Faun and c can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do Why of course I can said Lucy shaking him heartily by the hand And I do hope you won t get into dreadful trouble on my account Farewell Daughter of Eve said he Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief Rather said Lucy and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight a quickly a her leg would carry her And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her she felt coat and instead of crunching snow under her foot she felt wooden board and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around panting for breath It wa still raining and she could hear the voice of the others in the passage I m here she shouted I m here I ve come back I m all right CHAPTER III Edmund and the Wardrobe Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three It s all right she repeated I ve come back What on earth are you talking about Lucy asked Susan Why said Lucy in amazement haven t you all been wondering where I wa So you ve been hiding have you said Peter Poor old Lu hiding and nobody noticed You ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you But I ve been away for hour and hour said Lucy The others all stared at one another Batty said Edmund tapping his head Quite batty What do you mean Lu asked Peter What I said answered Lucy It wa just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe and I ve been away for hour and hour and had tea and all sort of thing have happened Don t be silly Lucy said Susan We ve only just come out of that room a moment ago and you were there then She s not being silly at all said Peter she s just making up a story for fun aren t you Lu And why shouldn t she No Peter I m not she said It s it s a magic wardrobe There s a wood inside it and it s snowing and there s a Faun and a witch and it s called Narnia come and see The others did not know what to think but Lucy wa so excited that they all went back with her into the room She rushed ahead of them flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried Now go in and see for yourselves Why you goose said Susan putting her head inside and pulling the fur coat apart it s just an ordinary wardrobe look there s the back of it Then everyone looked in and pulled the coat apart and they all saw Lucy herself saw a perfectly ordinary wardrobe There wa no wood and no snow only the back of the wardrobe with hook on it Peter went in and rapped his knuckle on it to make sure that it wa solid A jolly good hoax Lu he said a he came out again you have really taken u in I must admit We half believed you But it wasn t a hoax at all said Lucy really and truly It wa all different a moment ago Honestly it wa I promise Come Lu said Peter that s going a bit far You ve had your joke Hadn t you better drop it now Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something though she hardly knew what she wa trying to say and burst into tear For the next few day she wa very miserable She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing wa only a story made up for fun But Lucy wa a very truthful girl and she knew that she wa really in the right and she could not bring herself to say this The others who thought she wa telling a lie and a silly lie too made her very unhappy The two elder one did this without meaning to do it but Edmund could be spiteful and on this occasion he wa spiteful He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if she d found any other new country in other cupboard all over the house What made it worse wa that these day ought to have been delightful The weather wa fine and they were out of door from morning to night bathing fishing climbing tree bird nesting and lying in the heather But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it And so thing went on until the next wet day That day when it came to the afternoon and there wa still no sign of a break in the weather they decided to play hide and seek Susan wa It and a soon a the others scattered to hide Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe wa She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business But she did want to have one more look inside it for by this time she wa beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream The house wa so large and complicated and full of hiding place that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else But a soon a she reached it she heard step in the passage outside and then there wa nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe even if it is not a magic one Now the step she had heard were those of Edmund and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe He at once decided to get into it himself not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country He opened the door There were the coat hanging up a usual and a smell of mothball and darkness and silence and no sign of Lucy She think I m Susan come to catch her said Edmund to himself and so she s keeping very quiet in at the back He jumped in and shut the door forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark He had expected to find her in a few second and wa very surprised when he did not He decided to open the door again and let in some light But he could not find the door either He didn t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction he even shouted out Lucy Lu Where are you I know you re here There wa no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound not the sound you expect in a cupboard but a kind of open air sound He also noticed that he wa unexpectedly cold and then he saw a light Thank goodness said Edmund the door must have swung open of it own accord He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light which he thought wa the open door of the wardrobe But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir tree into an open place in the middle of a wood There wa crisp dry snow under his foot and more snow lying on the branch of the tree Overhead there wa a pale blue sky the sort of sky one see on a fine winter day in the morning Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree trunk the sun just rising very red and clear Everything wa perfectly still a if he were the only living creature in that country There wa not even a robin or a squirrel among the tree and the wood stretched a far a he could see in every direction He shivered He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her imaginary country which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted Lucy Lucy I m here too Edmund There wa no answer She s angry about all the thing I ve been saying lately thought Edmund And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong he also did not much like being alone in this strange cold quiet place so he shouted again I say Lu I m sorry I didn t believe you I see now you were right all along Do come out Make it Pax Still there wa no answer Just like a girl said Edmund to himself sulking somewhere and won t accept an apology He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place and had almost made up his mind to go home when he heard very far off in the wood a sound of bell He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer The reindeer were about the size of Shetland pony and their hair wa so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them their branching horn were gilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrise caught them Their harness wa of scarlet leather and covered with bell On the sledge driving the reindeer sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three foot high if he had been standing He wa dressed in polar bear s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from it point his huge beard covered his knee and served him instead of a rug But behind him on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person a great lady taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen She also wa covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head Her face wa white not merely pale but white like snow or paper or icing sugar except for her very red mouth It wa a beautiful face in other respect but proud and cold and stern The sledge wa a fine sight a it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bell jingling and the Dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it Stop said the Lady and the Dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bit and blowing In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostril looked like smoke And what pray are you said the Lady looking hard at Edmund I m I m my name s Edmund said Edmund rather awkwardly He did not like the way she looked at him The Lady frowned Is that how you address a Queen she asked looking sterner than ever I beg your pardon your Majesty I didn t know said Edmund Not know the Queen of Narnia cried she Ha You shall know u better hereafter But I repeat what are you Please your Majesty said Edmund I don t know what you mean I m at school at least I wa it s the holiday now CHAPTER IV Turkish Delight But what are you said the Queen again Are you a great overgrown dwarf that ha cut off it beard No your Majesty said Edmund I never had a beard I m a boy A boy said she Do you mean you are a Son of Adam Edmund stood still saying nothing He wa too confused by this time to understand what the question meant I see you are an idiot whatever else you may be said the Queen Answer me once and for all or I shall lose my patience Are you human Yes your Majesty said Edmund And how pray did you come to enter my dominion Please your Majesty I came in through a wardrobe A wardrobe What do you mean I I opened a door and just found myself here your Majesty said Edmund Ha said the Queen speaking more to herself than to him A door A door from the world of men I have heard of such thing This may wreck all But he is only one and he is easily dealt with As she spoke these word she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face her eye flaming at the same moment she raised her wand Edmund felt sure that she wa going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move Then just a he gave himself up for lost she appeared to change her mind My poor child she said in quite a different voice how cold you look Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her foot and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in Perhaps something hot to drink said the Queen Should you like that Yes please your Majesty said Edmund whose teeth were chattering The Queen took from somewhere among her wrapping a very small bottle which looked a if it were made of copper Then holding out her arm she let one drop fall from it on to the snow beside the sledge Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid air shining like a diamond But the moment it touched the snow there wa a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed The Dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile not a very nice smile Edmund felt much better a he began to sip the hot drink It wa something he had never tasted before very sweet and foamy and creamy and it warmed him right down to his toe It is dull Son of Adam to drink without eating said the Queen presently What would you like best to eat Turkish Delight please your Majesty said Edmund The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow and instantly there appeared a round box tied with green silk ribbon which when opened turned out to contain several pound of the best Turkish Delight Each piece wa sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious He wa quite warm now and very comfortable While he wa eating the Queen kept asking him question At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one s mouth full but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down a much Turkish Delight a he could and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sister and that one of his sister had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there and that no one except himself and his brother and his sister knew anything about Narnia She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it You are sure there are just four of you she asked Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve neither more nor le and Edmund with his mouth full of Turkish Delight kept on saying Yes I told you that before and forgetting to call her Your Majesty but she didn t seem to mind now At last the Turkish Delight wa all finished and Edmund wa looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more Probably the Queen knew quite well what he wa thinking for she knew though Edmund did not that this wa enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it and would even if they were allowed go on eating it till they killed themselves But she did not offer him any more Instead she said to him Son of Adam I should so much like to see your brother and your two sister Will you bring them to see me I ll try said Edmund still looking at the empty box Because if you did come again bringing them with you of course I d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight I can t do it now the magic will only work once In my own house it would be another matter Why can t we go to your house now said Edmund When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back but he had forgotten about that fear now It is a lovely place my house said the Queen I am sure you would like it There are whole room full of Turkish Delight and what s more I have no child of my own I want a nice boy whom I could bring up a a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone While he wa Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I ve ever met I think I would like to make you the Prince some day when you bring the others to visit me Why not now said Edmund His face had become very red and his mouth and finger were sticky He did not look either clever or handsome whatever the Queen might say Oh but if I took you there now said she I shouldn t see your brother and your sister I very much want to know your charming relation You are to be the Prince and later on the King that is understood But you must have courtier and noble I will make your brother a Duke and your sister Duchesses There s nothing special about them said Edmund and anyway I could always bring them some other time Ah but once you were in my house said the Queen you might forget all about them You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn t want the bother of going to fetch them No You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day with them you understand It is no good coming without them But I don t even know the way back to my own country pleaded Edmund That s easy answered the Queen Do you see that lamp She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp post under which Lucy had met the Faun Straight on beyond that is the way to the World of Men And now look the other way here she pointed in the opposite direction and tell me if you can see two little hill rising above the tree I think I can said Edmund Well my house is between those two hill So next time you come you have only to find the lamp post and look for those two hill and walk through the wood till you reach my house You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it But remember you must bring the others with you I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone I ll do my best said Edmund And by the way said the Queen you needn t tell them about me It would be fun to keep it a secret between u two wouldn t it Make it a surprise for them Just bring them along to the two hill a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that and when you come to my house you could just say Let s see who life here or something like that I am sure that would be best If your sister ha met one of the Fauns she may have heard strange story about me nasty story that might make her afraid to come to me Fauns will say anything you know and now Please please said Edmund suddenly please couldn t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home No no said the Queen with a laugh you must wait till next time While she spoke she signalled to the Dwarf to drive on but a the sledge swept away out of sight the Queen waved to Edmund calling out Next time Next time Don t forget Come soon Edmund wa still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood Oh Edmund she cried So you ve got in too Isn t it wonderful and now All right said Edmund I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all I ll say I m sorry if you like But where on earth have you been all this time I ve been looking for you everywhere If I d known you had got in I d have waited for you said Lucy who wa too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face wa I ve been having lunch with dear Mr Tumnus the Faun and he s very well and the White Witch ha done nothing to him for letting me go so he think she can t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all The White Witch said Edmund who s she She is a perfectly terrible person said Lucy She call herself the Queen of Narnia though she ha no right to be queen at all and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarf and animal at least all the good one simply hate her And she can turn people into stone and do all kind of horrible thing And she ha made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia always winter but it never get to Christmas And she drive about on a sledge drawn by a reindeer with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head Edmund wa already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweet and when he heard that the Lady he had made friend with wa a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch he asked Mr Tumnus the Faun said Lucy You can t always believe what Fauns say said Edmund trying to sound a if he knew far more about them than Lucy Who said so asked Lucy Everyone know it said Edmund ask anybody you like But it s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow Let s go home Yes let s said Lucy Oh Edmund I am glad you ve got in too The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of u have been there What fun it will be But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be a good fun for him a for her He would have to admit that Lucy had been right before all the others and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animal but he wa already more than half on the side of the Witch He did not know what he would say or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia By this time they had walked a good way Then suddenly they felt coat around them instead of branch and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room I say said Lucy you do look awful Edmund Don t you feel well I m all right said Edmund but this wa not true He wa feeling very sick Come on then said Lucy let s find the others What a lot we shall have to tell them And what wonderful adventure we shall have now that we re all in it together CHAPTER V Back on This Side of the Door Because the game of hide and seek wa still going on it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others But when at last they were all together which happened in the long room where the suit of armour wa Lucy burst out Peter Susan It s all true Edmund ha seen it too There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe Edmund and I both got in We met one another in there in the wood Go on Edmund tell them all about it What s all this about Ed said Peter And now we come to one of the nastiest thing in this story Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick and sulky and annoyed with Lucy for being right but he hadn t made up his mind what to do When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of He decided to let Lucy down Tell u Ed said Susan And Edmund gave a very superior look a if he were far older than Lucy there wa really only a year s difference and then a little snigger and said Oh yes Lucy and I have been playing pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true Just for fun of course There s nothing there really Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room Edmund who wa becoming a nastier person every minute thought that he had scored a great success and went on at once to say There she go again What s the matter with her That s the worst of young kid they always Look here said Peter turning on him savagely shut up You ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing game with her about it and setting her off again I believe you did it simply out of spite But it s all nonsense said Edmund very taken aback Of course it s all nonsense said Peter that s just the point Lu wa perfectly all right when we left home but since we ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar But whichever it is what good do you think you ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next I thought I thought said Edmund but he couldn t think of anything to say You didn t think anything at all said Peter it s just spite You ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself we ve seen that at school before now Do stop it said Susan it won t make thing any better having a row between you two Let s go and find Lucy It wa not surprising that when they found Lucy a good deal later everyone could see that she had been cry Nothing they could say to her made any difference She stuck to her story and said I don t care what you think and I don t care what you say You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like I know I ve met a Faun in there and I wish I d stayed there and you are all beast beast It wa an unpleasant evening Lucy wa miserable and Edmund wa beginning to feel that his plan wasn t working a well a he had expected The two older one were really beginning to think that Lucy wa out of her mind They stood in the passage talking about it in whisper long after she had gone to bed The result wa that next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor He ll write to Father if he think there is really something wrong with Lu said Peter it s getting beyond u So they went and knocked at the study door and the Professor said Come in and got up and found chair for them and said he wa quite at their disposal Then he sat listening to them with the tip of his finger pressed together and never interrupting till they had finished the whole story After that he said nothing for quite a long time Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected How do you know he asked that your sister s story is not true Oh but began Susan and then stopped Anyone could see from the old man s face that he wa perfectly serious Then Susan pulled herself together and said But Edmund said they had only been pretending That is a point said the Professor which certainly deserves consideration very careful consideration For instance if you will excuse me for asking the question doe your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister a the more reliable I mean which is the more truthful That s just the funny thing about it Sir said Peter Up till now I d have said Lucy every time And what do you think my dear said the Professor turning to Susan Well said Susan in general I d say the same a Peter but this couldn t be true all this about the wood and the Faun That is more than I know said the Professor and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing a very serious thing indeed We were afraid it mightn t even be lying said Susan We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy Madness you mean said the Professor quite coolly Oh you can make your mind easy about that One ha only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad But then said Susan and stopped She had never dreamed that a grown up would talk like the Professor and didn t know what to think Logic said the Professor half to himself Why don t they teach logic at these school There are only three possibility Either your sister is telling lie or she is mad or she is telling the truth You know she doesn t tell lie and it is obvious that she is not mad For the moment then and unless any further evidence turn up we must assume that she is telling the truth Susan looked at him very hard and wa quite sure from the expression on his face that he wa not making fun of them But how could it be true Sir said Peter Why do you say that asked the Professor Well for one thing said Peter if it wa real why doesn t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe I mean there wa nothing there when we looked even Lucy didn t pretend there wa What ha that to do with it said the Professor Well Sir if thing are real they re there all the time Are they said the Professor and Peter did not know quite what to say But there wa no time said Susan Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere even if there wa such a place She came running after u the very moment we were out of the room It wa le than a minute and she pretended to have been away for hour That is the very thing that make her story so likely to be true said the Professor If there really is a door in this house that lead to some other world and I should warn you that this is a very strange house and even I know very little about it if I say she had got into another world I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of it own so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time On the other hand I don t think many girl of her age would invent that idea for themselves If she had been pretending she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story But do you really mean Sir said Peter that there could be other world all over the place just round the corner like that Nothing is more probable said the Professor taking off his spectacle and beginning to polish them while he muttered to himself I wonder what they do teach them at these school But what are we to do said Susan She felt that the conversation wa beginning to get off the point My dear young lady said the Professor suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them there is one plan which no one ha yet suggested and which is well worth trying What s that said Susan We might all try minding our own business said he And that wa the end of that conversation After this thing were a good deal better for Lucy Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all It had become a rather alarming subject And so for a time it looked a if all the adventure were coming to an end but that wa not to be This house of the Professor s which even he knew so little about wa so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it It wa the sort of house that is mentioned in guide book and even in history and well it might be for all manner of story were told about it some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now And when party of sight seer arrived and asked to see the house the Professor always gave them permission and Mrs Macready the housekeeper showed them round telling them about the picture and the armour and the rare book in the library Mrs Macready wa not fond of child and did not like to be interrupted when she wa telling visitor all the thing she knew She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first morning along with a good many other instruction And please remember you re to keep out of the way whenever I m taking a party over the house Just a if any of u would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown ups said Edmund and the other three thought the same That wa how the adventure began for the second time A few morning later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bit when the two girl rushed into the room and said Look out Here come the Macready and a whole gang with her Sharp s the word said Peter and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it into the library they suddenly heard voice ahead of them and realised that Mrs Macready must be bringing her party of sight seer up the back stair instead of up the front stair a they had expected And after that whether it wa that they lost their head or that Mrs Macready wa trying to catch them or that some magic in the house had come to life and wa chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followed everywhere until at last Susan said Oh bother those tripper Here let s get into the Wardrobe Room till they ve passed No one will follow u in there But the moment they were inside they heard voice in the passage and then someone fumbling at the door and then they saw the handle turning Quick said Peter there s nowhere else and flung open the wardrobe All four of them bundled inside it and sat there panting in the dark Peter held the door closed but did not shut it for of course he remembered a every sensible person doe that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe CHAPTER VI Into the Forest I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away said Susan presently I m getting horribly cramped And what a filthy smell of camphor said Edmund I expect the pocket of these coat are full of it said Susan to keep away moth There s something sticking into my back said Peter And isn t it cold said Susan Now that you mention it it is cold said Peter and hang it all it s wet too What s the matter with this place I m sitting on something wet It s getting wetter every minute He struggled to his foot Let s get out said Edmund they ve gone O o oh said Susan suddenly And everyone asked her what wa the matter I m sitting against a tree said Susan and look It s getting lighter over there By jove you re right said Peter and look there and there It s tree all round And this wet stuff is snow Why I do believe we ve got into Lucy s wood after all And now there wa no mistaking it and all four child stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day Behind them were coat hanging on peg in front of them were snow covered tree Peter turned at once to Lucy I apologise for not believing you he said I m sorry Will you shake hand Of course said Lucy and did And now said Susan what do we do next Do said Peter why go and explore the wood of course Ugh said Susan stamping her foot it s pretty cold What about putting on some of these coat They re not ours said Peter doubtfully I am sure nobody would mind said Susan It isn t a if we wanted to take them out of the house we shan t take them even out of the wardrobe I never thought of that Su said Peter Of course now you put it that way I see No one could say you had bagged a coat a long a you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe They immediately carried out Susan s very sensible plan The coat were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heel and looked more like royal robe than coat when they had put them on But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get up and more suitable to the landscape We can pretend we are Arctic explorer said Lucy This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending said Peter a he began leading the way forward into the forest There were heavy darkish cloud overhead and it looked a if there might be more snow before night I say began Edmund presently oughtn t we to be bearing a bit more to the left that is if we are aiming for the lamp post He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before The moment the word were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away Everyone stopped everyone stared at him Peter whistled So you really were here he said that time Lu said she d met you in here and you made out she wa telling lie There wa a dead silence Well of all the poisonous little beast said Peter and shrugged his shoulder and said no more There seemed indeed no more to say and presently the four resumed their journey but Edmund wa saying to himself I ll pay you all out for this you pack of stuck up self satisfied prig Where are we going anyway said Susan chiefly for the sake of changing the subject I think Lu ought to be the leader said Peter goodness know she deserves it Where will you take u Lu What about going to see Mr Tumnus said Lucy He s the nice Faun I told you about Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their foot Lucy proved a good leader At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way but she recognised an odd looking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus cave But there a terrible surprise awaited them The door had been wrenched off it hinge and broken to bit Inside the cave wa dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several day Snow had drifted in from the doorway and wa heaped on the floor mixed with something black which turned out to be the charred stick and ash from the fire Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun s father had been slashed into shred with a knife This is a pretty good wash out said Edmund not much good coming here What s this said Peter stooping down He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor Is there anything written on it asked Susan Yes I think there is answered Peter but I can t read it in this light Let s get out into the open air They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter a he read out the following word The former occupant of these premise the Faun Tumnus is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis Queen of Narnia Chatelaine of Cair Paravel Empress of the Lone Islands etc also of comforting her said Majesty s enemy harbouring spy and fraternising with Humans Signed FENRIS ULF Captain of the Secret Police LONG LIVE THE QUEEN The child stared at each other I don t know that I m going to like this place after all said Susan Who is this Queen Lu said Peter Do you know anything about her She isn t a real queen at all answered Lucy she s a horrible witch the White Witch Everyone all the wood people hate her She ha made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas I I wonder if there s any point in going on said Susan I mean it doesn t seem particularly safe here and it look a if it won t be much fun either And it s getting colder every minute and we ve brought nothing to eat What about just going home Oh but we can t we can t said Lucy suddenly Don t you see We can t just go home not after this It is all on my account that the poor Faun ha got into this trouble He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back That s what it mean by comforting the Queen s enemy and fraternising with Humans We simply must try to rescue him A lot we could do said Edmund when we haven t even got anything to eat Shut up you said Peter who wa still very angry with Edmund What do you think Susan I ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right said Susan I don t want to go a step further and I wish we d never come But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever his name is I mean the Faun That s what I feel too said Peter I m worried about having no food with u I d vote for going back and getting something from the larder only there doesn t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you ve got out of it I think we ll have to go on So do I said both the girl If only we knew where the poor chap wa imprisoned said Peter They were all still wondering what to do next when Lucy said Look There s a robin with such a red breast It s the first bird I ve seen here I say I wonder can bird talk in Narnia It almost look a if it wanted to say something to u Then she turned to the Robin and said Please can you tell u where Tumnus the Faun ha been taken to As she said this she took a step towards the bird It at once hopped away but only a far a to the next tree There it perched and looked at them very hard a if it understood all they had been saying Almost without noticing that they had done so the four child went a step or two nearer to it At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard You couldn t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye Do you know said Lucy I really believe he mean u to follow him I ve an idea he doe said Susan what do you think Peter Well we might a well try it answered Peter The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly It kept going from tree to tree always a few yard ahead of them but always so near that they could easily follow it In this way it led them on slightly down hill Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch Presently the cloud parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour with the two girl in front when Edmund said to Peter If you re not still too high and mighty to talk to me I ve something to say which you d better listen to What is it asked Peter Hush Not so loud said Edmund there s no good frightening the girl But have you realised what we re doing What said Peter lowering his voice to a whisper We re following a guide we know nothing about How do we know which side that bird is on Why shouldn t it be leading u into a trap That s a nasty idea Still a robin you know They re good bird in all the story I ve ever read I m sure a robin wouldn t be on the wrong side If it come to that which is the right side How do we know that the faun are in the right and the Queen yes I know we ve been told she s a witch is in the wrong We don t really know anything about either The Faun saved Lucy He said he did But how do we know And there s another thing too Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here Great Scott said Peter I hadn t thought of that And no chance of dinner either said Edmund CHAPTER VII A Day with the Beavers While the two boy were whispering behind both the girl suddenly cried Oh and stopped The robin cried Lucy the robin It s flown away And so it had right out of sight And now what are we to do said Edmund giving Peter a look which wa a much a to say What did I tell you Sh Look said Susan What said Peter There s something moving among the tree over there to the left They all stared a hard a they could and no one felt very comfortable There it go again said Susan presently I saw it that time too said Peter It s still there It s just gone behind that big tree What is it asked Lucy trying very hard not to sound nervous Whatever it is said Peter it s dodging u It s something that doesn t want to be seen Let s go home said Susan And then though nobody said it out loud everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter They were lost What s it like said Lucy It s it s a kind of animal said Susan and then Look Look Quick There it is They all saw it this time a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree But this time it didn t immediately draw back Instead the animal put it paw against it mouth just a human put their finger on their lip when they are signalling to you to be quiet Then it disappeared again The child all stood holding their breath A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree glanced all round a if it were afraid someone wa watching said Hush made sign to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it wa standing and then once more disappeared I know what it is said Peter it s a beaver I saw the tail It want u to go to it said Susan and it is warning u not to make a noise I know said Peter The question is are we to go to it or not What do you think Lu I think it s a nice beaver said Lucy Yes but how do we know said Edmund Shan t we have to risk it said Susan I mean it s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner At this moment the Beaver again popped it head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them Come on said Peter let s give it a try All keep close together We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turn out to be an enemy So the child all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it and there sure enough they found the Beaver but it still drew back saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper Further in come further in Right in here We re not safe in the open Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four tree grew so close together that their bough met and the brown earth and pine needle could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there did it begin to talk to them Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve it said We re some of them said Peter S s s sh said the Beaver not so loud please We re not safe even here Why who are you afraid of said Peter There s no one here but ourselves There are the tree said the Beaver They re always listening Most of them are on our side but there are tree that would betray u to her you know who I mean and it nodded it head several time If it come to talking about side said Edmund how do we know you re a friend Not meaning to be rude Mr Beaver added Peter but you see we re stranger Quite right quite right said the Beaver Here is my token With these word it held up to them a little white object They all looked at it in surprise till suddenly Lucy said Oh of course It s my handkerchief the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus That s right said the Beaver Poor fellow he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to Here the Beaver s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nod Then signalling to the child to stand a close around it a they possibly could so that their face were actually tickled by it whisker it added in a low whisper They say Aslan is on the move perhaps ha already landed And now a very curious thing happened None of the child knew who Aslan wa any more than you do but the moment the Beaver had spoken these word everyone felt quite different Perhaps it ha sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone say something which you don t understand but in the dream it feel a if it had some enormous meaning either a terrifying one which turn the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into word which make the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again It wa like that now At the name of Aslan each one of the child felt something jump in his inside Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous Susan felt a if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holiday or the beginning of summer And what about Mr Tumnus said Lucy where is he S s s sh said the Beaver not here I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the Beaver now and everyone including Edmund wa very glad to hear the word dinner They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace and always in the thickest part of the forest for over an hour Everyone wa feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the tree began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply down hill A minute later they came out under the open sky the sun wa still shining and found themselves looking down on a fine sight They were standing on the edge of a steep narrow valley at the bottom of which ran at least it would have been running if it hadn t been frozen a fairly large river Just below them a dam had been built across this river and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beaver are always making dam and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they ve made or reading a story they ve written So it wa only common politeness when Susan said What a lovely dam And Mr Beaver didn t say Hush this time but Merely a trifle Merely a trifle And it isn t really finished Above the dam there wa what ought to have been a deep pool but wa now of course a level floor of dark green ice And below the dam much lower down wa more ice but instead of being smooth this wa all frozen into the foamy and wavy shape in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there wa now a glittering wall of icicle a if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flower and wreath and festoon of the purest sugar And out in the middle and partly on the top of the dam wa a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous bee hive and from a hole in the roof smoke wa going up so that when you saw it especially if you were hungry you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before That wa what the others chiefly noticed but Edmund noticed something else A little lower down the river there wa another small river which came down another small valley to join it And looking up that valley Edmund could see two small hill and he wa almost sure they were the two hill which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp post that other day And then between them he thought must be her palace only a mile off or le And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King And I wonder how Peter will like that he asked himself and horrible idea came into his head Here we are said Mr Beaver and it look a if Mrs Beaver is expecting u I ll lead the way But be careful and don t slip The top of the dam wa wide enough to walk on though not for human a very nice place to walk because it wa covered with ice and though the frozen pool wa level with it on one side there wa a nasty drop to the lower river on the other Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house Here we are Mrs Beaver said Mr Beaver I ve found them Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve and they all went in The first thing Lucy noticed a she went in wa a burring sound and the first thing she saw wa a kind looking old she beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine and it wa from it that the sound came She stopped her work and got up a soon a the child came in So you ve come at last she said holding out both her wrinkled old paw At last To think that ever I should live to see this day The potato are on boiling and the kettle s singing and I daresay Mr Beaver you ll get u some fish That I will said Mr Beaver and he went out of the house Peter went with him and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet They took a pail with them Mr Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole he didn t seem to mind it s being so chilly looked hard into it then suddenly shot in his paw and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish Meanwhile the girl were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plate in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house and to put on the frying pan and get the dripping hot Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it wa not at all like Mr Tumnus s cave There were no book or picture and instead of bed there were bunk like on board ship built into the wall And there were ham and string of onion hanging from the roof and against the wall were gum boot and oilskin and hatchet and pair of shear and spade and trowel and thing for carrying mortar in and fishing rod and fishing net and sack And the cloth on the table tho very clean wa very rough Just a the frying pan wa nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fish which Mr Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air You can think how good the new caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry child longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mrs Beaver said Now we re nearly ready Susan drained the potato and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy wa helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout so that in a very few minute everyone wa drawing up stool it wa all three legged stool in the Beavers house except for Mrs Beaver s own special rocking chair beside the fire and preparing to enjoy themselves There wa a jug of creamy milk for the child Mr Beaver stuck to beer and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took a much a he wanted to go with his potato and all the child thought and I agree with them that there s nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat it when it ha been alive half an hour ago and ha come out of the pan half a minute ago And when they had finished the fish Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll steaming hot and at the same time moved the kettle on to the fire so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea wa made and ready to be poured out And when each person had got his or her cup of tea each person shoved back his or her stool so a to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment And now said Mr Beaver pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him if you ll just wait till I ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely why now we can get to business It s snowing again he added cocking his eye at the window That s all the better because it mean we shan t have any visitor and if anyone should have been trying to follow you why he won t find any track CHAPTER VIII What Happened after Dinner And now said Lucy do please tell u what s happened to Mr Tumnus Ah that s bad said Mr Beaver shaking his head That s a very very bad business There s no doubt he wa taken off by the police I got that from a bird who saw it done But where s he been taken to asked Lucy Well they were heading northward when they were last seen and we all know what that mean No we don t said Susan But Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion I m afraid it mean they were taking him to her house said Mr Beaver But what ll they do to him Mr Beaver gasped Lucy Well said Mr Beaver you can t exactly say for sure But there s not many taken in there that ever come out again Statues All full of statue they say it is in the courtyard and up the stair and in the hall People she s turned he paused and shuddered turned into stone But Mr Beaver said Lucy can t we I mean we must do something to save him It s too dreadful and it s all on my account I don t doubt you d save him if you could dearie said Mrs Beaver but you ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive Couldn t we have some stratagem said Peter I mean couldn t we dress up a something or pretend to be oh pedlar or anything or watch till she wa gone out or oh hang it all there must be some way This Faun saved my sister at his own risk Mr Beaver We can t just leave him to be to be to have that done to him It s no good Son of Adam said Mr Beaver no good your trying of all people But now that Aslan is on the move Oh yes Tell u about Aslan said several voice at once for once again that strange feeling like the first sign of spring like good news had come over them Who is Aslan asked Susan Aslan said Mr Beaver Why don t you know He s the King He s the Lord of the whole wood but not often here you understand Never in my time or my father s time But the word ha reached u that he ha come back He is in Narnia at this moment He ll settle the White Queen all right It is he not you that will save Mr Tumnus She won t turn him into stone too said Edmund Lord love you Son of Adam what a simple thing to say answered Mr Beaver with a great laugh Turn him into stone If she can stand on her two foot and look him in the face it ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her No no He ll put all to right a it say in an old rhyme in these part Wrong will be right when Aslan come in sight At the sound of his roar sorrow will be no more When he bares his teeth winter meet it death And when he shake his mane we shall have spring again You ll understand when you see him But shall we see him asked Susan Why Daughter of Eve that s what I brought you here for I m to lead you where you shall meet him said Mr Beaver Is is he a man asked Lucy Aslan a man said Mr Beaver sternly Certainly not I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor Beyond the Sea Don t you know who is the King of Beasts Aslan is a lion the Lion the great Lion Ooh said Susan I d thought he wa a man Is he quite safe I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion That you will dearie and no mistake said Mrs Beaver if there s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knee knocking they re either braver than most or else just silly Then he isn t safe said Lucy Safe said Mr Beaver Don t you hear what Mrs Beaver tell you Who said anything about safe Course he isn t safe But he s good He s the King I tell you I m longing to see him said Peter even if I do feel frightened when it come to the point That s right Son of Adam said Mr Beaver bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cup and saucer rattle And so you shall Word ha been sent that you are to meet him to morrow if you can at the Stone Table Where s that said Lucy I ll show you said Mr Beaver It s down the river a good step from here I ll take you to it But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus said Lucy The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan said Mr Beaver once he s with u then we can begin doing thing Not that we don t need you too For that s another of the old rhyme When Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Sits at Cair Paravel in throne The evil time will be over and done So thing must be drawing near their end now he s come and you ve come We ve heard of Aslan coming into these part before long ago nobody can say when But there s never been any of your race here before That s what I don t understand Mr Beaver said Peter I mean isn t the Witch herself human She d like u to believe it said Mr Beaver and it s on that that she base her claim to be Queen But she s no Daughter of Eve She come of your father Adam s here Mr Beaver bowed your father Adam s first wife her they called Lilith And she wa one of the Jinn That s what she come from on one side And on the other she come of the giant No no there isn t a drop of real Human blood in the Witch That s why she s bad all through Mr Beaver said Mrs Beaver True enough Mrs Beaver replied he there may be two view about Humans meaning no offence to the present company But there s no two view about thing that look like Humans and aren t I ve known good dwarf said Mrs Beaver So ve I now you come to speak of it said her husband but precious few and they were the one least like men But in general take my advice when you meet anything that s going to be Human and isn t yet or used to be Human once and isn t now or ought to be Human and isn t you keep your eye on it and feel for your hatchet And that s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia She s been watching for you this many a year and if she knew there were four of you she d be more dangerous still What s that to do with it asked Peter Because of another prophecy said Mr Beaver Down at Cair Paravel that s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all wa a it should be down at Cair Paravel there are four throne and it s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four throne then it will be the end not only of the White Witch s reign but of her life and that is why we had to be so cautious a we came along for if she knew about you four your life wouldn t be worth a shake of my whisker All the child had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver wa telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark Lucy suddenly said I say where s Edmund There wa a dreadful pause and then everyone began asking Who saw him last How long ha he been missing Is he outside And then all rushed to the door and looked out The snow wa falling thickly and steadily the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank Out they went plunging well over their ankle into the soft new snow and went round the house in every direction Edmund Edmund they called till they were hoarse But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voice and there wa not even an echo in answer How perfectly dreadful said Susan a they at last came back in despair Oh how I wish we d never come What on earth are we to do Mr Beaver said Peter Do said Mr Beaver who wa already putting on his snow boot do We must be off at once We haven t a moment to spare We d better divide into four search party said Peter and all go in different direction Whoever find him must come back here at once and Search party Son of Adam said Mr Beaver what for Why to look for Edmund of course There s no point in looking for him said Mr Beaver What do you mean said Susan he can t be far away yet And we ve got to find him What do you mean when you say there s no use looking for him The reason there s no use looking said Mr Beaver is that we know already where he s gone Everyone stared in amazement Don t you understand said Mr Beaver He s gone to her to the White Witch He ha betrayed u all Oh surely oh really said Susan he can t have done that Can t he said Mr Beaver looking very hard at the three child and everything they wanted to say died on their lip for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this wa exactly what Edmund had done But will he know the way said Peter Has he been in this country before asked Mr Beaver ha he ever been here alone Yes said Lucy almost in a whisper I m afraid he ha And did he tell you what he d done or who he d met Well no he didn t said Peter Then mark my word said Mr Beaver he ha already met the White Witch and joined her side and been told where she life I didn t like to mention it before he being your brother and all but the moment I set eye on that brother of yours I said to myself Treacherous He had the look of one who ha been with the Witch and eaten her food You can always tell them if you ve lived long in Narnia something about their eye All the same said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice we ll still have to go and look for him He is our brother after all even if he is rather a little beast and he s only a kid Go to the Witch s house said Mrs Beaver Don t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her How do you mean said Lucy Why all she want is to get all four of you she s thinking all the time of those four throne at Cair Paravel Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done and there d be four new statue in her collection before you d had time to speak But she ll keep him alive a long a he s the only one she s got because she ll want to use him a a decoy a bait to catch the rest of you with Oh can no one help u wailed Lucy Only Aslan said Mr Beaver we must go on and meet him That s our only chance now It seems to me my dear said Mrs Beaver that it is very important to know just when he slipped away How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard For instance had we started talking of Aslan before he left If not then we may do very well for she won t know that Aslan ha come to Narnia or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard a far a that is concerned I don t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan began Peter but Lucy interrupted him Oh yes he wa she said miserably don t you remember it wa he who asked whether the Witch couldn t turn Aslan into stone too So he did by Jove said Peter just the sort of thing he would say too Worse and worse said Mr Beaver and the next thing is this Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan wa the Stone Table And of course no one knew the answer to this question Because if he wa continued Mr Beaver then she ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between u and the Stone Table and catch u on our way down In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan But that isn t what she ll do first said Mrs Beaver not if I know her The moment that Edmund tell her that we re all here she ll set out to catch u this very night and if he s been gone about half an hour she ll be here in about another twenty minute You re right Mrs Beaver said her husband we must all get away from here There s not a moment to lose CHAPTER IX In the Witch s House And now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund He had eaten his share of the dinner but he hadn t really enjoyed it because he wa thinking all the time about Turkish Delight and there s nothing that spoil the taste of good ordinary food half so much a the memory of bad magic food And he had heard the conversation and hadn t enjoyed it much either because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder They weren t but he imagined it And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table It wa then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just a it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling Just a Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam s flesh and Adam s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door handle and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn t really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him You mustn t think that even now Edmund wa quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sister to be turned into stone He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince and later a King and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast As for what the Witch would do with the others he didn t want her to be particularly nice to them certainly not to put them on the same level a himself but he managed to believe or to pretend he believed that she wouldn t do anything very bad to them Because he said to himself all these people who say nasty thing about her are her enemy and probably half of it isn t true She wa jolly nice to me anyway much nicer than they are I expect she is the rightful Queen really Anyway she ll be better than that awful Aslan At least that wa the excuse he made in his own mind for what he wa doing It wasn t a very good excuse however for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch wa bad and cruel The first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all around him wa that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers house And of course there wa no chance of going back to get it now The next thing he realised wa that the daylight wa almost gone for it had been nearly three o clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter day were short He hadn t reckoned on this but he had to make the best of it So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam luckily it wasn t so slippery since the snow had fallen to the far side of the river It wa pretty bad when he reached the far side It wa growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflake swirling all round him he could hardly see three foot ahead And then too there wa no road He kept slipping into deep drift of snow and skidding on frozen puddle and tripping over fallen tree trunk and sliding down steep bank and barking his shin against rock till he wa wet and cold and bruised all over The silence and the loneliness were dreadful In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friend with the others if he hadn t happened to say to himself When I m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent road And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other thing he would do and this cheered him up a good deal He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many car and all about his private cinema and where the principal railway would run and what law he would make against beaver and dam and wa putting the finishing touch to some scheme for keeping Peter in his place when the weather changed First the snow stopped Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold Finally the cloud rolled away and the moon came out It wa a full moon and shining on all that snow it made everything almost a bright a day only the shadow were rather confusing He would never have found his way if the moon hadn t come out by the time he got to the other river you remember he had seen when they first arrived at the Beavers a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down He now reached this and turned to follow it up But the little valley down which it came wa much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bush so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark Even a it wa he got wet through for he had to stoop to go under branch and great load of snow came sliding off on to his back And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter just a if all this had been Peter s fault But at last he came to a part where it wa more level and the valley opened out And there on the other side of the river quite close to him in the middle of a little plain between two hill he saw what must be the White Witch s house And the moon wa shining brighter than ever The house wa really a small castle It seemed to be all tower little tower with long pointed spire on them sharp a needle They looked like huge dunce s cap or sorcerer s cap And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadow looked strange on the snow Edmund began to be afraid of the house But it wa too late to think of turning back now He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the house There wa nothing stirring not the slightest sound anywhere Even his own foot made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow He walked on and on past corner after corner of the house and past turret after turret to find the door He had to go right round to the far side before he found it It wa a huge arch but the great iron gate stood wide open Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating Just inside the gate with the moonlight shining on it stood an enormous lion crouched a if it wa ready to spring And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch afraid to go on and afraid to go back with his knee knocking together He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear How long this really lasted I don t know but it seemed to Edmund to last for hour Then at last he began to wonder why the lion wa standing so still for it hadn t moved one inch since he first set eye on it Edmund now ventured a little nearer still keeping in the shadow of the arch a much a he could He now saw from the way the lion wa standing that it couldn t have been looking at him at all But supposing it turn it head thought Edmund In fact it wa staring at something else namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four foot away Aha thought Edmund When it spring at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape But still the lion never moved nor did the dwarf And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone Perhaps this wa only a stone lion And a soon a he had thought of that he noticed that the lion s back and the top of it head were covered with snow Of course it must be only a statue No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow Then very slowly and with his heart beating a if it would burst Edmund ventured to go up to the lion Even now he hardly dared to touch it but at last he put out his hand very quickly and did It wa cold stone He had been frightened of a mere statue The relief which Edmund felt wa so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toe and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea Probably he thought this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about She s caught him already and turned him into stone So that s the end of all their fine idea about him Pooh Who s afraid of Aslan And he stood there gloating over the stone lion and presently he did something very silly and childish He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion s upper lip and then a pair of spectacle on it eye Then he said Yah Silly old Aslan How do you like being a stone You thought yourself mighty fine didn t you But in spite of the scribble on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible and sad and noble staring up in the moonlight that Edmund didn t really get any fun out of jeering at it He turned away and began to cross the courtyard As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozen of statue all about standing here and there rather a the piece stand on a chess board when it is half way through the game There were stone satyr and stone wolf and bear and fox and cat a mountain of stone There were lovely stone shape that looked like woman but who were really the spirit of tree There wa the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon They all looked so strange standing there perfectly lifelike and also perfectly still in the bright cold moonlight that it wa eerie work crossing the courtyard Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man but a tall a a tree with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in it right hand Even though he knew that it wa only a stone giant and not a live one Edmund did not like going past it He now saw that there wa a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard He went to it there wa a flight of stone step going up to an open door Edmund went up them Across the threshold lay a great wolf It s all right it s all right he kept saying to himself it s only a stone wolf It can t hurt me and he raised his leg to step over it Instantly the huge creature rose with all the hair bristling along it back opened a great red mouth and said in a growling voice Who s there Who s there Stand still stranger and tell me who you are If you please Sir said Edmund trembling so that he could hardly speak my name is Edmund and I m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sister are now in Narnia quite close in the Beavers house She she wanted to see them I will tell Her Majesty said the Wolf Meanwhile stand still on the threshold a you value your life Then it vanished into the house Edmund stood and waited his finger aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest and presently the grey Wolf Fenris Ulf the Chief of the Witch s Secret Police came bounding back and said Come in Come in Fortunate favourite of the Queen or else not so fortunate And Edmund went in taking great care not to tread on the Wolf s paw He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillar full a the courtyard had been of statue The one nearest the door wa a little Faun with a very sad expression on it face and Edmund couldn t help wondering if this might be Lucy s friend The only light came from a single lamp and close behind this sat the White Witch I m come your Majesty said Edmund rushing eagerly forward How dare you come alone said the Witch in a terrible voice Did I not tell you to bring the others with you Please your Majesty said Edmund I ve done the best I can I ve brought them quite close They re in the little house on top of the dam just up the river with Mr and Mrs Beaver A slow cruel smile came over the Witch s face Is this all your news she asked No your Majesty said Edmund and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers house What Aslan cried the Queen Aslan Is this true If I find you have lied to me Please I m only repeating what they said stammered Edmund But the Queen who wa no longer attending to him clapped her hand Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared Make ready our sledge ordered the Witch and use the harness without bell CHAPTER X The Spell Begins to Break Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other child As soon a Mr Beaver said There s no time to lose everyone began bundling themselves into coat except Mrs Beaver who started picking up sack and laying them on the table and said Now Mr Beaver just reach down that ham And here s a packet of tea and there s sugar and some match And if someone will get two or three loaf out of the crock over there in the corner What are you doing Mrs Beaver exclaimed Susan Packing a load for each of u dearie said Mrs Beaver very coolly You didn t think we d set out on a journey with nothing to eat did you But we haven t time said Susan buttoning the collar of her coat She may be here any minute That s what I say chimed in Mr Beaver Get along with you all said his wife Think it over Mr Beaver She can t be here for a quarter of an hour at least But don t we want a big a start a we can possibly get said Peter if we re to reach the Stone Table before her You ve got to remember that Mrs Beaver said Susan As soon a she ha looked in here and find we re gone she ll be off at top speed That she will said Mrs Beaver But we can t get there before her whatever we do for she ll be on a sledge and we ll be walking Then have we no hope said Susan Now don t you get fussing there s a dear said Mrs Beaver but just get half a dozen clean handkerchief out of that drawer Course we ve got a hope We can t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by way she won t expect and perhaps we ll get through That s true enough Mrs Beaver said her husband But it s time we were out of this And don t you start fussing either Mr Beaver said his wife There That s better There s four load and the smallest for the smallest of u that s you my dear she added looking at Lucy Oh do please come on said Lucy Well I m nearly ready now answered Mrs Beaver at last allowing her husband to help her into her snow boot I suppose the sewing machine s too heavy to bring Yes It is said Mr Beaver A great deal too heavy And you don t think you ll be able to use it while we re on the run I suppose I can t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it said Mrs Beaver and breaking it or stealing it a likely a not Oh please please please do hurry said the three child And so at last they all got outside and Mr Beaver locked the door It ll delay her a bit he said and they set off all carrying their load over their shoulder The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey They went in single file first Mr Beaver then Lucy then Peter then Susan and Mrs Beaver last of all Mr Beaver led them across the dam and onto the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the tree right down by the river bank The side of the valley shining in the moonlight towered up far above them on either hand Best keep down here a much a possible he said She ll have to keep to the top for you couldn t bring a sledge down here It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair and even a thing were Lucy enjoyed it at first But a they went on walking and walking and walking and a the sack she wa carrying felt heavier and heavier she began to wonder how she wa going to keep up at all And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all it waterfall of ice and at the white mass of the tree top and the great glaring moon and the countless star and could only watch the little short leg of Mr Beaver going pad pad pad pad through the snow in front of her a if they were never going to stop Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more And at last Lucy wa so tired that she wa almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the river bank to the right and wa leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bush And then a she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver wa just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bush until you were quite on top of it In fact by the time she realised what wa happening only his short flat tail wa showing Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him Then she heard noise of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside Wherever is this said Peter s voice sounding tired and pale in the darkness I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale It s an old hiding place for beaver in bad time said Mr Beaver and a great secret It s not much of a place but we must get a few hour sleep If you hadn t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting I d have brought some pillow said Mrs Beaver It wasn t nearly such a nice cave a Mr Tumnus s Lucy thought just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy It wa very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of fur and clothes together and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you d swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep It seemed to Lucy only the next minute though really it wa hour and hour later when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath Then she felt a set of long whisker tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave But immediately after that she wa very wide awake indeed and so wa everyone else In fact they were all sitting up with their mouth and eye wide open listening to a sound which wa the very sound they d all been thinking of and sometimes imagining they heard during their walk last night It wa a sound of jingling bell Mr Beaver wa out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it Perhaps you think a Lucy thought for a moment that this wa a very silly thing for him to do But it wa really a very sensible one He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bush and bramble without being seen and he wanted above all thing to see which way the Witch s sledge went The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering They waited nearly five minute Then they heard something that frightened them very much They heard voice Oh thought Lucy he s been seen She s caught him Great wa their surprise when a little later they heard Mr Beaver s voice calling to them from just outside the cave It s all right he wa shouting Come out Mrs Beaver Come out Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve It s all right It isn t her This wa bad grammar of course but that is how beaver talk when they are excited I mean in Narnia in our world they usually don t talk at all So Mrs Beaver and the child came bundling out of the cave all blinking in the daylight and with earth all over them and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eye Come on cried Mr Beaver who wa almost dancing with delight Come and see This is a nasty knock for the Witch It look a if her power wa already crumbling What do you mean Mr Beaver panted Peter a they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together Didn t I tell you answered Mr Beaver that she d made it always winter and never Christmas Didn t I tell you Well just come and see And then they were all at the top and did see It wa a sledge and it wa reindeer with bell on their harness But they were far bigger than the Witch s reindeer and they were not white but brown And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eye on him He wa a huge man in a bright red robe bright a holly berry with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest Everyone knew him because though you see people of his sort only in Narnia you see picture of them and hear them talked about even in our world the world on this side of the wardrobe door But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different Some of the picture of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly But now that the child actually stood looking at him they didn t find it quite like that He wa so big and so glad and so real that they all became quite still They felt very glad but also solemn I ve come at last said he She ha kept me out for a long time but I have got in at last Aslan is on the move The Witch s magic is weakening And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still And now said Father Christmas for your present There is a new and better sewing machine for you Mrs Beaver I will drop it in your house a I pas If you please sir said Mrs Beaver making a curtsey It s locked up Locks and bolt make no difference to me said Father Christmas And a for you Mr Beaver when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leak stopped and a new sluice gate fitted Mr Beaver wa so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn t say anything at all Peter Adam s Son said Father Christmas Here Sir said Peter These are your present wa the answer and they are tool not toy The time to use them is perhaps near at hand Bear them well With these word he handed to Peter a shield and a sword The shield wa the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion a bright a a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it The hilt of the sword wa of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed and it wa just the right size and weight for Peter to use Peter wa silent and solemn a he received these gift for he felt they were a very serious kind of present Susan Eve s Daughter said Father Christmas These are for you and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrow and a little ivory horn You must use the bow only in great need he said for I do not mean you to fight in the battle It doe not easily miss And when you put this horn to your lip and blow it then wherever you are I think help of some kind will come to you Last of all he said Lucy Eve s Daughter and Lucy came forward He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass but people said afterwards that it wa made of diamond and a small dagger In this bottle he said there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire flower that grow in the mountain of the sun If you or any of your friend are hurt a few drop of this will restore you And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need For you also are not to be in the battle Why Sir said Lucy I think I don t know but I think I could be brave enough That is not the point he said But battle are ugly when woman fight And now here he suddenly looked le grave here is something for the moment for you all and he brought out I suppose from the big bag at his back but nobody quite saw him do it a large tray containing five cup and saucer a bowl of lump sugar a jug of cream and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot Then he cried out A Merry Christmas Long live the true King and cracked his whip and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started Peter had just drawn his sword out of it sheath and wa showing it to Mr Beaver when Mrs Beaver said Now then now then Don t stand talking there till the tea s got cold Just like men Come and help to carry the tray down and we ll have breakfast What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread knife So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwich and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed himself But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said Time to be moving on now CHAPTER XI Aslan Is Nearer Edmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time When the Dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him a she had been at their last meeting But she said nothing at all And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say Please your Majesty could I have some Turkish Delight You you said she answered Silence fool Then she appeared to change her mind and said a if to herself And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way and once more clapped her hand Another dwarf appeared Bring the human creature food and drink she said The Dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it He grinned in a repulsive manner a he set them down the floor beside Edmund and said Turkish Delight for the little Prince Ha Ha Ha Take it away said Edmund sulkily I don t want dry bread But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologised and began to nibble at the bread though it wa so stale he could hardly get it down You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again said the Witch While he wa still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge wa ready The White Witch rose and went out ordering Edmund to go with her The snow wa again falling a they came into the courtyard but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge But before they drove off she called Fenris Ulf and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge Take with you the swiftest of your wolf and go at once to the house of the Beavers said the Witch and kill whatever you find there If they are already gone then make all speed to the Stone Table but do not be seen Wait for me there in hiding I meanwhile must go many mile to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river You may overtake these human before they reach the Stone Table You will know what to do if you find them I hear and obey O Queen growled the Wolf and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness a quickly a a horse can gallop In a few minute he had called another wolf and wa with him down on the dam and sniffing at the Beavers house But of course they found it empty It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the child if the night had remained fine for the wolf would then have been able to follow their trail and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave But now that the snow had begun again the scent wa cold and even the footprint were covered up Meanwhile the Dwarf whipped up the reindeer and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold This wa a terrible journey for Edmund who had no coat Before they had been going a quarter of ah hour all the front of him wa covered with snow he soon stopped trying to shake it off because a quickly a he did that a new lot gathered and he wa so tired Soon he wa wet to the skin And oh how miserable he wa It didn t look now a if the Witch intended to make him a King All the thing he had said to make himself believe that she wa good and kind and that her side wa really the right side sounded to him silly now He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment even Peter The only way to comfort himself now wa to try to believe that the whole thing wa a dream and that he might wake up at any moment And a they went on hour after hour it did come to seem like a dream This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote page and page about it But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight And still they went on and on with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer s harness And then at last the Witch said What have we here Stop and they did How Edmund hoped she wa going to say something about breakfast But she had stopped for quite a different reason A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party a squirrel and his wife with their child and two satyr and a dwarf and an old dog fox all on stool round a table Edmund couldn t quite see what they were eating but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decoration of holly and he wasn t at all sure that he didn t see something like a plum pudding At the moment when the sledge stopped the Fox who wa obviously the oldest person present had just risen to it foot holding a glass in it right paw a if it wa going to say something But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who wa in it all the gaiety went out of their face The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half way to his mouth and one of the satyr stopped with it fork actually in it mouth and the baby squirrel squealed with terror What is the meaning of this asked the Witch Queen Nobody answered Speak vermin she said again Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip What is the meaning of all this gluttony this waste this self indulgence Where did you get all these thing Please your Majesty said the Fox we were given them And if I might make so bold a to drink your Majesty s very good health Who gave them to you said the Witch F F F Father Christmas stammered the Fox What roared the Witch springing from the sledge and taking a few stride nearer to the terrified animal He ha not been here He can not have been here How dare you but no Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven At that moment one of the young squirrel lost it head completely He ha he ha he ha it squeaked beating it little spoon on the table Edmund saw the Witch bite her lip so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek Then she raised her wand Oh don t don t please don t shouted Edmund but even while he wa shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statue of creature one with it stone fork fixed forever half way to it stone mouth seated round a stone table on which there were stone plate and a stone plum pudding As for you said the Witch giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face a she re mounted the sledge let that teach you to ask favour for spy and traitor Drive on And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figure sitting there all the silent day and all the dark night year after year till the moss grew on them and at last even their face crumbled away Now they were steadily racing on again And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them a they rushed through it wa much wetter than it had been all last night At the same time he noticed that he wa feeling much le cold It wa also becoming foggy In fact every minute it grew both foggier and warmer And the sledge wa not running nearly a well a it had been running up till now At first he thought this wa because the reindeer were tired but soon he saw that that couldn t be the real reason The sledge jerked and skidded and kept on jolting a if it had struck against stone And however the Dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them but the noise of their driving and jolting and the Dwarf s shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it wa until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn t go on at all When that happened there wa a moment s silence And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly A strange sweet rustling chattering noise and yet not so strange for he knew he d heard it before if only he could remember where Then all at once he did remember It wa the noise of running water All round them though out of sight there were stream chattering murmuring bubbling splashing and even in the distance roaring And his heart gave a great leap though he hardly knew why when he realised that the frost wa over And much nearer there wa a drip drip drip from the branch of all the tree And then a he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree But he hadn t time to listen or watch any longer for the Witch said Don t sit staring fool Get out and help And of course Edmund had to obey He stepped out into the snow but it wa really only slush by now and began helping the Dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into They got it out in the end and by being very cruel to the reindeer the Dwarf managed to get it on the move again and they drove a little further And now the snow wa really melting in earnest and patch of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction Unless you have looked at a world of snow a long a Edmund had been looking at it you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patch were after the endless white Then the sledge stopped again It s no good your Majesty said the Dwarf We can t sledge in this thaw Then we must walk said the Witch We shall never overtake them walking growled the dwarf Not with the start they ve got Are you my councillor or my slave said the Witch Do a you re told Tie the hand of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope And take your whip And cut the harness of the reindeer they ll find their own way home The Dwarf obeyed and in a few minute Edmund found himself being forced to walk a fast a he could with his hand tied behind him He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass and every time he slipped the Dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying Faster Faster Every moment the patch of green grew bigger and the patch of snow grew smaller Every moment more and more of the tree shook off their robe of snow Soon wherever you looked instead of white shape you saw the dark green of fir or the black prickly branch of bare oak and beech and elm Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree top Soon there were more wonderful thing happening Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch tree Edmund saw the ground covered in all direction with little yellow flower celandine The noise of water grew louder Presently they actually crossed a stream Beyond it they found snowdrop growing Mind your own business said the Dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them and he gave the rope a vicious jerk But of course this didn t prevent Edmund from seeing Only five minute later he noticed a dozen crocus growing round the foot of an old tree gold and purple and white Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree It wa answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off And then a if that had been a signal there wa chattering and chirruping in every direction and then a moment of full song and within five minute the whole wood wa ringing with bird music and wherever Edmund s eye turned he saw bird alighting on branch or sailing overhead or having their little quarrel Faster Faster said the Witch There wa no trace of the fog now The sky became bluer and bluer and now there were white cloud hurrying across it from time to time In the wide glade there were primrose A light breeze sprang up which scattered drop of moisture from the swaying branch and carried cool delicious scent against the face of the traveller The tree began to come fully alive The larch and birch were covered with green the laburnum with gold Soon the beech tree had put forth their delicate transparent leaf As the traveller walked under them the light also became green A bee buzzed across their path This is no thaw said the Dwarf suddenly stopping This is spring What are we to do Your winter ha been destroyed I tell you This is Aslan s doing If either of you mention that name again said the Witch he shall instantly be killed CHAPTER XII Peter s First Battle While the Dwarf and the White Witch were saying this mile away the Beaver and the child were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream Long ago they had left the coat behind them And by now they had even stopped saying to one another Look There s a kingfisher or I say bluebell or What wa that lovely smell or Just listen to that thrush They walked on in silence drinking it all in passing through patch of warm sunlight into cool green thicket and out again into wide mossy glade where tall elm raised the leafy roof far overhead and then into dense mass of flowering currant and among hawthorn bush where the sweet smell wa almost overpowering They had been just a surprised a Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hour or so from January to May They hadn t even known for certain a the Witch did that this wa what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia But they all knew that it wa her spell which had produced the endless winter and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong and badly wrong with the Witch s scheme And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge After that they didn t hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rest and longer one They were pretty tired by now of course but not what I d call bitterly tired only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside a one doe when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open Susan had a slight blister on one heel They had left the course of the big river some time ago for one had to turn a little to the right that meant a little to the South to reach the place of the Stone Table Even if this had not been their way they couldn t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began for with all that melting snow the river wa soon in flood a wonderful roaring thundering yellow flood and their path would have been under water And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadow got longer and the flower began to think about closing Not long now said Mr Beaver and began leading them uphill across some very deep springy moss it felt nice under their tired foot in a place where only tall tree grew very wide apart The climb coming at the end of the long day made them all pant and blow And just a Lucy wa wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest suddenly they were at the top And this is what they saw They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading a far a one could see in every direction except right ahead There far to the East wa something twinkling and moving By gum whispered Peter to Susan The sea In the very middle of this open hilltop wa the Stone Table It wa a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stone It looked very old and it wa cut all over with strange line and figure that might be the letter of an unknown language They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them The next thing they saw wa a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place A wonderful pavilion it wa and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it with side of what looked like yellow silk and cord of crimson and tent peg of ivory and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion fluttered in the breeze which wa blowing in their face from the far off sea While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creature who had grouped themselves around him in the shape of a half moon There were Tree Women there and Well Women Dryads and Naiads a they used to be called in our world who had stringed instrument it wa they who had made the music There were four great centaur The horse part of them wa like huge English farm horse and the man part wa like stern but beautiful giant There wa also a unicorn and a bull with the head of a man and a pelican and an eagle and a great dog And next to Aslan stood two leopard of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard But a for Aslan himself the Beavers and the child didn t know what to do or say when they saw him People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing can not be good and terrible at the same time If the child had ever thought so they were cured of it now For when they tried to look at Aslan s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great royal solemn overwhelming eye and then they found they couldn t look at him and went all trembly Go on whispered Mr Beaver No whispered Peter you first No Sons of Adam before animal whispered Mr Beaver back again Susan whispered Peter what about you Ladies first No you re the eldest whispered Susan And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt Then at last Peter realised that it wa up to him He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others Come on Pull yourselves together he advanced to the Lion and said We have come Aslan Welcome Peter Son of Adam said Aslan Welcome Susan and Lucy Daughters of Eve Welcome He Beaver and She Beaver His voice wa deep and rich and somehow took the fidget out of them They now felt glad and quiet and it didn t seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing But where is the fourth asked Aslan He ha tried to betray them and joined the White Witch O Aslan said Mr Beaver And then something made Peter say That wa partly my fault Aslan I wa angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great golden eye And it seemed to all of them that there wa nothing to be said Please Aslan said Lucy can anything be done to save Edmund All shall be done said Aslan But it may be harder than you think And then he wa silent again for some time Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad a well But next minute that expression wa quite gone The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paw together Terrible paw thought Lucy If he didn t know how to velvet them and said Meanwhile let the feast be prepared Ladies take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them When the girl had gone Aslan laid his paw and though it wa velveted it wa very heavy on Peter s shoulder and said Come Son of Adam and I will show you a far off sight of the castle where you are to be King And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hill top There a beautiful sight met their eye The sun wa setting behind their back That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light forest and hill and valley and winding away like a silver snake the lower part of the great river And beyond all this mile away wa the sea and beyond the sea the sky full of cloud which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset But just where the land of Narnia met the sea in fact at the mouth of the great river there wa something on a little hill shining It wa shining because it wa a castle and of course the sunlight wa reflected from all the window which looked towards Peter and the sunset but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore That O Man said Aslan is Cair Paravel of the four throne in one of which you must sit a King I show it to you because you are the first born and you will be High King over all the rest And once more Peter said nothing for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly It wa like a bugle but richer It is your sister s horn said Aslan to Peter in a low voice so low a to be almost a purr if it is not disrespectful to think of a lion purring For a moment Peter did not understand Then when he saw all the other creature start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw Back Let the Prince win his spur he did understand and set off running a hard a he could to the pavilion And there he saw a dreadful sight The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction Lucy wa running towards him a fast a her short leg would carry her and her face wa a white a paper Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree and swing herself up followed by a huge grey beast At first Peter thought it wa a bear Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian though it wa far too big to be a dog Then he realised that it wa a wolf a wolf standing on it hind leg with it front paw against the tree trunk snapping and snarling All the hair on it back stood up on end Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch One of her leg hung down so that her foot wa only an inch or two above the snapping teeth Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip then he realised that she wa just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off Peter did not feel very brave indeed he felt he wa going to be sick But that made no difference to what he had to do He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at it side That stroke never reached the Wolf Quick a lightning it turned round it eye flaming and it mouth wide open in a howl of anger If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once As it wa though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword a hard a he could between the brute s foreleg into it heart Then came a horrible confused moment like something in a nightmare He wa tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead and it bared teeth knocked against his forehead and everything wa blood and heat and hair A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and wa straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eye He felt tired all over Then after a bit Susan came down the tree She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won t say there wasn t kissing and cry on both side But in Narnia no one think any the worse of you for that Quick Quick shouted the voice of Aslan Centaurs Eagles I see another wolf in the thicket There behind you He ha just darted away After him all of you He will be going to his mistress Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam And instantly with a thunder of hoof and a beating of wing a dozen or so of the swiftest creature disappeared into the gathering darkness Peter still out of breath turned and saw Aslan close at hand You have forgotten to clean your sword said Aslan It wa true Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf s hair and blood He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass and then wiped it quite dry on his coat Hand it to me and kneel Son of Adam said Aslan And when Peter had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said Rise up Sir Peter Fenris Bane And whatever happens never forget to wipe your sword CHAPTER XIII Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time Now we must go back to Edmund When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir tree and yew tree Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all and not even caring what wa going to happen next provided they would let him lie still He wa too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he wa The Witch and the Dwarf were talking close beside him in low tone No said the Dwarf it is no use now O Queen They must have reached the Stone Table by now Perhaps the Wolf will smell u out and bring u news said the Witch It can not be good news if he doe said the Dwarf Four throne in Cair Paravel said the Witch How if only three were filled That would not fulfil the prophecy What difference would that make now that he is here said the Dwarf He did not dare even now to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress He may not stay long And then we would fall upon the three at Cair Yet it might be better said the Dwarf to keep this one here he kicked Edmund for bargaining with Yes And have him rescued said the Witch scornfully Then said the Dwarf we had better do what we have to do at once I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself said the Witch That is the proper place That is where it ha always been done before It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to it proper use said the Dwarf True said the Witch and then Well I will begin At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them I have seen them They are all at the Stone Table with him They have killed my captain Fenris Ulf I wa hidden in the thicket and saw it all One of the Sons of Adam killed him Fly Fly No said the Witch There need be no flying Go quickly Summon all our people to meet me here a speedily a they can Call out the giant and the werewolf and the spirit of those tree who are on our side Call the Ghouls and the Boggles the Ogres and the Minotaurs Call the Cruels the Hags the Spectres and the people of the Toadstools We will fight What Have I not still my wand Will not their rank turn into stone even a they come on Be off quickly I have a little thing to finish here while you are away The great brute bowed it head turned and galloped away Now said she we have no table let me see We had better put it against the trunk of a tree Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his foot Then the Dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle Her arm were bare underneath it and terribly white Because they were so very white he could not see much else it wa so dark in this valley under the dark tree Prepare the victim said the Witch And the Dwarf undid Edmund s collar and folded back his shirt at the neck Then he took Edmund s hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin After that Edmund heard a strange noise whizz whizz whizz For a moment he couldn t think what it wa Then he realised It wa the sound of a knife being sharpened At that very moment he heard loud shout from every direction a drumming of hoof and a beating of wing a scream from the Witch confusion all round him And then he found he wa being untied Strong arm were round him and he heard big kind voice saying thing like Let him lie down give him some wine drink this steady now you ll be all right in a minute Then he heard the voice of people who were talking not to him but to one another And they were saying thing like Who s got the Witch I thought you had her I didn t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand I wa after the Dwarf Do you mean to say she s escaped A chap can t mind everything at once What s that Oh sorry it s only an old stump But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint Presently the centaur and unicorn and deer and bird they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter all set off to go back to the Stone Table carrying Edmund with them But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone I think they might have been surprised It wa perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree stump and on a fair sized boulder But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there wa something odd about both the stump and the boulder And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the Dwarf For it wa part of her magic that she could make thing look like what they weren t and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife wa knocked out of her hand She had kept hold of her wand also so it had been kept safe too When the other child woke up next morning they had been sleeping on pile of cushion in the pavilion the first thing they heard from Mrs Beaver wa that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night and wa at that moment with Aslan As soon a they had breakfasted they all went out and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass apart from the rest of the court There is no need to tell you and no one ever heard what Aslan wa saying but it wa a conversation which Edmund never forgot As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them bringing Edmund with him Here is your brother he said and there is no need to talk to him about what is past Edmund shook hand with each of the others and said to each of them in turn I m sorry and everyone said That s all right And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friend with him again something ordinary and natural and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopard approached Aslan and said Sire there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience Let him approach said Aslan The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch s Dwarf What is your message Son of Earth asked Aslan The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desire a safe conduct to come and speak with you said the Dwarf on a matter which is a much to your advantage a to hers Queen of Narnia indeed said Mr Beaver Of all the cheek Peace Beaver said Aslan All name will soon be restored to their proper owner In the meantime we will not dispute about noise Tell your mistress Son of Earth that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaf her wand behind her at that great oak This wa agreed to and two leopard went back with the Dwarf to see that the condition were properly carried out But supposing she turn the two leopard into stone whispered Lucy to Peter I think the same idea had occurred to the leopard themselves at any rate a they walked off their fur wa all standing up on their back and their tail were bristling like a cat s when it see a strange dog It ll be all right whispered Peter in reply He wouldn t send them if it weren t A few minute later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan The three child who had not seen her before felt shudder running down their back at the sight of her face and there were low growl among all the animal present Though it wa bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself It wa the oddest thing to see those two face the golden face and the dead white face so close together Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eye Mrs Beaver particularly noticed this You have a traitor there Aslan said the Witch Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he d been through and after the talk he d had that morning He just went on looking at Aslan It didn t seem to matter what the Witch said Well said Aslan His offence wa not against you Have you forgotten the Deep Magic asked the Witch Let u say I have forgotten it answered Aslan gravely Tell u of this Deep Magic Tell you said the Witch her voice growing suddenly shriller Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stand beside u Tell you what is written in letter deep a a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor Beyond the Sea You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning You know that every traitor belongs to me a my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill Oh said Mr Beaver So that s how you came to imagine yourself a Queen because you were the Emperor s hangman I see Peace Beaver said Aslan with a very low growl And so continued the Witch that human creature is mine His life is forfeit to me His blood is my property Come and take it then said the Bull with the man s head in a great bellowing voice Fool said the Witch with a savage smile that wa almost a snarl do you really think your master can rob me of my right by mere force He know the Deep Magic better than that He know that unless I have blood a the Law say all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water It is very true said Aslan I do not deny it Oh Aslan whispered Susan in the Lion s ear can t we I mean you won t will you Can t we do something about the Deep Magic Isn t there something you can work against it Work against the Emperor s magic said Aslan turning to her with something like a frown on his face And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again Edmund wa on the other side of Aslan looking all the time at Aslan s face He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something but a moment later he felt that he wa not expected to do anything except to wait and do what he wa told Fall back all of you said Aslan and I will talk to the Witch alone They all obeyed It wa a terrible time this waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voice Lucy said Oh Edmund and began to cry Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea The Beavers stood holding each other s paw with their head bowed The centaur stamped uneasily with their hoof But everyone became perfectly still in the end so that you noticed even small sound like a bumble bee flying past or the bird in the forest down below them or the wind rustling the leaf And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on At last they heard Aslan s voice You can all come back he said I have settled the matter She ha renounced the claim on your brother s blood And all over the hill there wa a noise a if everyone had been holding his breath and had now begun breathing again and then a murmur of talk They began to come back to Aslan s throne The Witch wa just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said But how do I know this promise will be kept Wow roared Aslan half rising from his throne and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder and the Witch after staring for a moment with her lip wide apart picked up her skirt and fairly ran for her life CHAPTER XIV The Triumph of the Witch As soon a the Witch had gone Aslan said We must move from this place at once it will be wanted for other purpose We shall encamp to night at the Fords of Beruna Of course everyone wa dying to ask him how he had arranged matter with the Witch but his face wa stern and everyone s ear were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared After a meal which wa taken in the open air on the hill top for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing thing up Before two o clock they were on the march and set off in a North Westerly direction walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign As soon a she ha finished her business in these part he said the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it He then went on to outline two plan of battle one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle And all the time he wa advising Peter how to conduct the operation saying thing like You must put your centaur in such and such a place or You must post scout to see that she doesn t do so and so till at last Peter said But you will be there yourself Aslan I can give you no promise of that answered the Lion And he continued giving Peter his instruction For the last part of the journey it wa Susan and Lucy who saw most of him He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad It wa still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river wa broad and shallow This wa the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave order to halt on this side of the water But Peter said Wouldn t it be better to camp on the far side for fear she should try a night attack or anything Aslan who seemed to have been thinking about something else roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said Eh What s that Peter said it all over again No said Aslan in a dull voice a if it didn t matter No She will not make an attack to night And then he sighed deeply But presently he added All the same it wa well thought of That is how a soldier ought to think But it doesn t really matter So they proceeded to pitch their camp Aslan s mood affected everyone that evening Peter wa feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own the news that Aslan might not be there had come a a great shock to him Supper that evening wa a quiet meal Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning It wa a if the good time having just begun were already drawing to their end This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn t get to sleep when she went to bed And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness Can t you get to sleep either said Susan No said Lucy I thought you were asleep I say Susan What I ve a most horrible feeling a if something were hanging over u Have you Because a a matter of fact so have I Something about Aslan said Lucy Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him or something dreadful that he s going to do There s been something wrong with him all afternoon said Susan Lucy What wa that he said about not being with u at the battle You don t think he could be stealing away and leaving u to night do you Where is he now said Lucy Is he here in the pavilion I don t think so Susan Let s go outside and have a look round We might see him All right Let s said Susan we might just a well be doing that a lying awake here Very quietly the two girl groped their way among the other sleeper and crept out of the tent The moonlight wa bright and everything wa quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stone Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy s arm and said Look On the far side of the camping ground just where the tree began they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood Without a word they both followed him He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the left apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table On and on he led them into dark shadow and out into pale moonlight getting their foot wet with the heavy dew He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly a if he were very very tired Then when they were crossing a wide open place where there were no shadow for them to hide in he stopped and looked round It wa no good trying to run away so they came towards him When they were closer he said Oh child child why are you following me We couldn t sleep said Lucy and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking Please may we come with you wherever you re going said Susan Well said Aslan and seemed to be thinking Then he said I should be glad of company to night Yes you may come if you will promise to stop when I tell you and after that leave me to go on alone Oh thank you thank you And we will said the two girl Forward they went again and one of the girl walked on each side of the Lion But how slowly he walked And his great royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan Aslan Dear Aslan said Lucy what is wrong Can t you tell u Are you ill dear Aslan asked Susan No said Aslan I am sad and lonely Lay your hand on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let u walk like that And so the girl did what they would never have dared to do without his permission but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him buried their cold hand in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and so doing walked with him And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood They went up at the side where the tree came furthest up and when they got to the last tree it wa one that had some bush about it Aslan stopped and said Oh child child Here you must stop And whatever happens do not let yourselves be seen Farewell And both the girl cried bitterly though they hardly knew why and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paw and his great sad eye Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill And Lucy and Susan crouching in the bush looked after him and this is what they saw A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon wa shining many of them carried torch which burned with evil looking red flame and black smoke But such people Ogres with monstrous teeth and wolf and bull headed men spirit of evil tree and poisonous plant and other creature whom I won t describe because if I did the grown ups would probably not let you read this book Cruels and Hags and Incubuses Wraiths Horrors Efreets Sprites Orknies Wooses and Ettins In fact here were all those who were on the Witch s side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command And right in the middle standing by the Table wa the Witch herself A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creature when they first saw the great Lion pacing towards them and for a moment the Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear Then she recovered herself and gave a wild fierce laugh The fool she cried The fool ha come Bind him fast Lucy and Susan held their breath waiting for Aslan s roar and his spring upon his enemy But it never came Four hag grinning and leering yet also at first hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do had approached him Bind him I say repeated the White Witch The hag made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all Then others evil dwarf and ape rushed in to help them and between them they rolled the huge Lion round on his back and tied all his four paw together shouting and cheering a if they had done something brave though had the Lion chosen one of those paw could have been the death of them all But he made no noise even when the enemy straining and tugging pulled the cord so tight that they cut into his flesh Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table Stop said the Witch Let him first be shaved Another roar of mean laughter went up from her follower a an ogre with a pair of shear came forward and squatted down by Aslan s head Snip snip snip went the shear and mass of curling gold began to fall to the ground Then the ogre stood back and the child watching from their hiding place could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without it mane The enemy also saw the difference Why he s only a great cat after all cried one Is that what we were afraid of said another And they surged round Aslan jeering at him saying thing like Puss Puss Poor Pussy and How many mouse have you caught to day Cat and Would you like a saucer of milk Pussums Oh how can they said Lucy tear streaming down her cheek The brute the brute for now that the first shock wa over the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver and more beautiful and more patient than ever Muzzle him said the Witch And even now a they worked about his face putting on the muzzle one bite from his jaw would have cost two or three of them their hand But he never moved And this seemed to enrage all that rabble Everyone wa at him now Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he wa bound began to find their courage and for a few minute the two girl could not even see him so thickly wa he surrounded by the whole crowd of creature kicking him hitting him spitting on him jeering at him At last the rabble had had enough of this They began to drag the bound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table some pulling and some pushing He wa so huge that even when they got him there it took all their effort to hoist him onto the surface of it Then there wa more tying and tightening of cord The coward The coward sobbed Susan Are they still afraid of him even now When once Aslan had been tied and tied so that he wa really a mass of cord on the flat stone a hush fell on the crowd Four Hags holding four torch stood at the corner of the Table The Witch bared her arm a she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan Then she began to whet her knife It looked to the child when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it a if the knife were made of stone not of steel and it wa of a strange and evil shape At last she drew near She stood by Aslan s head Her face wa working and twitching with passion but his looked up at the sky still quiet neither angry nor afraid but a little sad Then just before she gave the blow she stooped down and said in a quivering voice And now who ha won Fool did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor Now I will kill you instead of him a our pact wa and so the Deep Magic will be appeased But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him a well And who will take him out of my hand then Understand that you have given me Narnia forever you have lost your own life and you have not saved his In that knowledge despair and die The child did not see the actual moment of the killing They couldn t bear to look and had covered their eye CHAPTER XV Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time While the two girl still crouched in the bush with their hand over their face they heard the voice of the Witch calling out Now Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war It will not take u long to crush the human vermin and the traitor now that the great Fool the great Cat lie dead At this moment the child were for a few second in very great danger For with wild cry and a noise of skirling pipe and shrill horn blowing the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill top and down the slope right past their hiding place They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping foot of the Minotaurs and overhead there went a flurry of foul wing and a blackness of vulture and giant bat At any other time they would have trembled with fear but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan s death so filled their mind that they hardly thought of it As soon a the wood wa silent again Susan and Lucy crept out into the open hill top The moon wa getting low and thin cloud were passing across her but still they could see the shape of the great Lion lying dead in his bond And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur what wa left of it and cried till they could cry no more And then they looked at each other and held each other s hand for mere loneliness and cried again and then again were silent At last Lucy said I can t bear the look of that horrible muzzle I wonder could we take it off So they tried And after a lot of working at it for their finger were cold and it wa now the darkest part of the night they succeeded And when they saw his face without it they burst out cry again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam a well a they could And it wa all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe I wonder could we untie him a well said Susan presently But the enemy out of pure spitefulness had drawn the cord so tight that the girl could make nothing of the knot I hope no one who read this book ha been quite a miserable a Susan and Lucy were that night but if you have been if you ve been up all night and cried till you have no more tear left in you you will know that there come in the end a sort of quietness You feel a if nothing wa ever going to happen again At any rate that wa how it felt to these two Hours and hour seemed to go by in this dead calm and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder But at last Lucy noticed two other thing One wa that the sky on the East side of the hill wa a little le dark than it had been an hour ago The other wa some tiny movement going on in the grass at her foot At first she took no interest in this What did it matter Nothing mattered now But at last she saw that whatever it wa had begun to move up the upright stone of the Stone Table And now whatever they were were moving about on Aslan s body She peered closer They were little grey thing Ugh said Susan from the other side of the Table How beastly There are horrid little mouse crawling over him Go away you little beast And she raised her hand to frighten them away Wait said Lucy who had been looking at them more closely still Can you see what they re doing Both girl bent down and stared I do believe said Susan But how queer They re nibbling away at the cord That s what I thought said Lucy I think they re friendly mouse Poor little thing they don t realise he s dead They think it ll do some good untying him It wa quite definitely lighter by now Each of the girl noticed for the first time the white face of the other They could see the mouse nibbling away dozen and dozen even hundred of little field mouse And at last one by one the rope were all gnawed through The sky in the East wa whitish by now and the star were getting fainter all except one very big one low down on the Eastern horizon They felt colder than they had been all night The mouse crept away again The girl cleared away the remains of the gnawed rope Aslan looked more like himself without them Every moment his dead face looked nobler a the light grew and they could see it better In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound It had been so still for hour and hour that it startled them Then another bird answered it Soon there were bird singing all over the place It wa quite definitely early morning now not late night I m so cold said Lucy So am I said Susan Let s walk about a bit They walked to the Eastern edge of the hill and looked down The one big star had almost disappeared The country all looked dark grey but beyond at the very end of the world the sea showed pale The sky began to turn red They walked to and fro more time than they could count between the dead Aslan and the Eastern ridge trying to keep warm and oh how tired their leg felt Then at last a they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel which they could now just make out the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise a great cracking deafening noise a if a giant had broken a giant s plate What s that said Lucy clutching Susan s arm I I feel afraid to turn round said Susan something awful is happening They re doing something worse to him said Lucy Come on And she turned pulling Susan round with her The rising of the sun had made everything look so different all the colour and shadow were changed that for a moment they didn t see the important thing Then they did The Stone Table wa broken into two piece by a great crack that ran down it from end to end and there wa no Aslan Oh oh oh cried the two girl rushing back to the Table Oh it s too bad sobbed Lucy they might have left the body alone Who s done it cried Susan What doe it mean Is it more magic Yes said a great voice behind their back It is more magic They looked round There shining in the sunrise larger than they had seen him before shaking his mane for it had apparently grown again stood Aslan himself Oh Aslan cried both the child staring up at him almost a much frightened a they were glad Aren t you dead then dear Aslan said Lucy Not now said Aslan You re not not a asked Susan in a shaky voice She couldn t bring herself to say the word ghost Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her Do I look it he said Oh you re real you re real Oh Aslan cried Lucy and both girl flung themselves upon him and covered him with kiss But what doe it all mean asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer It mean said Aslan that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic there is a magic deeper still which she did not know Her knowledge go back only to the dawn of Time But if she could have looked a little further back into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned she would have read there a different incantation She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery wa killed in a traitor s stead the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards And now Oh yes Now said Lucy jumping up and clapping her hand Oh child said the Lion I feel my strength coming back to me Oh child catch me if you can He stood for a second his eye very bright his limb quivering lashing himself with his tail Then he made a leap high over their head and landed on the other side of the Table Laughing though she didn t know why Lucy scrambled over it to reach him Aslan leaped again A mad chase began Round and round the hill top he led them now hopelessly out of their reach now letting them almost catch his tail now diving between them now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paw and catching them again and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arm and leg It wa such a romp a no one ha ever had except in Narnia and whether it wa more like playing with a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind And the funny thing wa that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girl no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty And now said Aslan presently to business I feel I am going to roar You had better put your finger in your ear And they did And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it And they saw all the tree in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring a grass bend in a meadow before the wind Then he said We have a long journey to go You must ride on me And he crouched down and the child climbed onto his warm golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off faster than any horse could go downhill and into the thick of the forest That ride wa perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia Have you ever had a gallop on a horse Think of that and then take away the heavy noise of the hoof and the jingle of the harness and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paw Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur and the mane flying back in the wind And then imagine you are going about twice a fast a the fastest racehorse But this is a mount that doesn t need to be guided and never grows tired He rush on and on never missing his footing never hesitating threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunk jumping over bush and briar and the smaller stream wading the larger swimming the largest of all And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the down but right across Narnia in spring down solemn avenue of beech and across sunny glade of oak through wild orchard of snow white cherry tree past roaring waterfall and mossy rock and echoing cavern up windy slope alight with gorse bush and across the shoulder of heathery mountain and along giddy ridge and down down down again into wild valley and out into acre of blue flower It wa nearly mid day when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle a little toy castle it looked from where they stood which seemed to be all pointed tower But the Lion wa rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it wa they were already on a level with it And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them No face looked over the battlement and the gate were fast shut And Aslan not at all slacking his pace rushed straight a a bullet towards it The Witch s home he cried Now child hold tight Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down and the child felt a if they had left their inside behind them for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped or you may call it flying rather than jumping right over the castle wall The two girl breathless but unhurt found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statue CHAPTER XVI What Happened about the Statues What an extraordinary place cried Lucy All those stone animal and people too It s it s like a museum Hush said Susan Aslan s doing something He wa indeed He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him Then without waiting a moment he whisked round almost a if he had been a cat chasing it tail and breathed also on the stone dwarf which a you remember wa standing a few foot from the lion with his back to it Then he pounced on a tall stone Dryad which stood beyond the dwarf turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right and rushed on to two centaur But at that moment Lucy said Oh Susan Look Look at the lion I expect you ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire And for a second nothing seems to have happened and then you notice a tiny streak of flame creeping along the edge of the newspaper It wa like that now For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back then it spread then the colour seemed to lick all over him a the flame lick all over a bit of paper then while his hind quarter were still obviously stone the lion shook his mane and all the heavy stony fold rippled into living hair Then he opened a great red mouth warm and living and gave a prodigious yawn And now his hind leg had come to life He lifted one of them and scratched himself Then having caught sight of Aslan he went bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face Of course the child s eye turned to follow the lion but the sight they saw wa so wonderful that they soon forgot about him Everywhere the statue were coming to life The courtyard looked no longer like a museum it looked more like a zoo Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he wa almost hidden in the crowd Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard wa now a blaze of colour glossy chestnut side of centaur indigo horn of unicorn dazzling plumage of bird reddy brown of fox dog and satyr yellow stocking and crimson hood of dwarf and the birch girl in silver and the beech girl in fresh transparent green and the larch girl in green so bright that it wa almost yellow And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roaring brayings yelping barkings squealings cooings neighings stampings shout hurrah song and laughter Ooh said Susan in a different tone Look I wonder I mean is it safe Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the foot of the stone giant It s all right shouted Aslan joyously Once the foot are put right all the rest of him will follow That wasn t exactly what I meant whispered Susan to Lucy But it wa too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her The change wa already creeping up the Giant s leg Now he wa moving his foot A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder rubbed his eye and said Bless me I must have been asleep Now Where s that dratted little Witch that wa running about on the ground Somewhere just by my foot it wa But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood then he bowed down till his head wa no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan beaming all over his honest ugly face giant of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giant are good tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming It s a sight well worth looking at Now for the inside of this house said Aslan Look alive everyone Up stair and down stair and in my lady s chamber Leave no corner unsearched You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed And into the interior they all rushed and for several minute the whole of that dark horrible fusty old castle echoed with the opening of window and with everyone s voice cry out at once Don t forget the dungeon Give u a hand with this door Here s another little winding stair Oh I say Here s a poor little kangaroo Call Aslan Phew How it smell in here Look out for trap door Up here There are a whole lot more on the landing But the best of all wa when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out Aslan Aslan I ve found Mr Tumnus Oh do come quick A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding one another by both hand and dancing round and round for joy The little chap wa none the worse for having been a statue and wa of course very interested in all she had to tell him But at last the ransacking of the Witch s fortress wa ended The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil place which needed them so badly The whole crowd of liberated statue surged back into the courtyard And it wa then that someone Tumnus I think first said But how are we going to get out for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gate were still locked That ll be all right said Aslan and then rising on his hind leg he bawled up at the Giant Hi You up there he roared What s your name Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour said the Giant once more touching his cap Well then Giant Rumblebuffin said Aslan just let u out of this will you Certainly your honour It will be a pleasure said Giant Rumblebuffin Stand well away from the gate all you little un Then he strode to the gate himself and bang bang bang went his huge club The gate creaked at the first blow cracked at the second and shivered at the third Then he tackled the tower on each side of them and after a few minute of crashing and thudding both the tower and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble and when the dust cleared it wa odd standing in that dry grim stony yard to see through the gap all the grass and waving tree and sparkling stream of the forest and the blue hill beyond that and beyond them the sky Blowed if I ain t all in a muck sweat said the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine Comes of being out of condition I suppose neither of you young lady ha such a thing a a pocket handkerchee about you Yes I have said Lucy standing on tip toe and holding her handkerchief up a far a she could reach Thank you Missie said Giant Rumblebuffin stooping down Next moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid air between the Giant s finger and thumb But just a she wa getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering Bless me I ve picked up the little girl instead I beg your pardon Missie I thought you wa the handkerchee No no said Lucy laughing here it is This time he managed to get it but it wa only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face she said I m afraid it s not much use to you Mr Rumblebuffin Not at all Not at all said the Giant politely Never met a nicer handkerchee So fine so handy So I don t know how to describe it What a nice giant he is said Lucy to Mr Tumnus Oh yes replied the Faun All the Buffins always were One of the most respected of all the giant family in Narnia Not very clever perhaps I never knew a giant that wa but an old family With tradition you know If he d been the other sort she d never have turned him into stone At this point Aslan clapped his paw together and called for silence Our day s work is not yet over he said and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed time we must find the battle at once And join in I hope Sir added the largest of the centaur Of course said Aslan And now Those who can t keep up that is child dwarf and small animal must ride on the back of those who can that is lion centaur unicorn horse giant and eagle Those who are good with their nose must come in the front with u lion to smell out where the battle is Look lively and sort yourselves And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did The most pleased of the lot wa the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met Did you hear what he said Us lion That mean him and me Us lion That s what I like about Aslan No side no stand off ishness Us lion That meant him and me At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarf one Dryad two rabbit and a hedgehog That steadied him a bit When all were ready it wa a big sheep dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order they set out through the gap in the castle wall At first the lion and dog went nosing about in all direction But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay There wa no time lost after that Soon all the dog and lion and wolf and other hunting animal were going at full speed with their nose to the ground and all the others streaked out for about half a mile behind them were following a fast a they could The noise wa like an English fox hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hound wa mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself Faster and faster they went a the scent became easier and easier to follow And then just a they came to the last curve in a narrow winding valley Lucy heard above all these noise another noise a different one which gave her a queer feeling inside It wa a noise of shout and shriek and of the clashing of metal against metal Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan s army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creature whom she had seen last night only now in the daylight they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed There also seemed to be far more of them Aslan s army which had their back to her looked terribly few And there were statue dotted all over the battlefield so apparently the Witch had been using her wand But she did not seem to be using it now She wa fighting with her stone knife It wa Peter she wa fighting both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what wa happening she only saw the stone knife and Peter s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knife and three sword That pair were in the centre On each side the line stretched out Horrible thing were happening wherever she looked Off my back child shouted Aslan And they both tumbled off Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the Western lamp post to the shore of the Eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath and at the same moment all war like creature whom Aslan had led from the Witch s house rushed madly on the enemy s line dwarf with their battle ax dog with teeth the giant with his club and his foot also crushed dozen of the foe unicorn with their horn centaur with sword and hoof And Peter s tired army cheered and the newcomer roared and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re echoed with the din of that onset CHAPTER XVII The Hunting of the White Stag The battle wa all over a few minute after their arrival Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his companion and when those who were still living saw that the Witch wa dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight The next thing that Lucy knew wa that Peter and Aslan were shaking hand It wa strange to her to see Peter looking a he looked now his face wa so pale and stern and he seemed so much older It wa all Edmund s doing Aslan Peter wa saying We d have been beaten if it hadn t been for him The Witch wa turning our troop into stone right and left But nothing would stop him He fought his way through three ogre to where she wa just turning one of your leopard into a statue And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pain That wa the mistake all the rest were making Once her wand wa broken we began to have some chance if we hadn t lost so many already He wa terribly wounded We must go and see him They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from the fighting line He wa covered with blood his mouth wa open and his face a nasty green colour Quick Lucy said Aslan And then almost for the first time Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present Her hand trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper but she managed it in the end and poured a few drop into her brother s mouth There are other people wounded said Aslan while she wa still looking eagerly into Edmund s pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result Yes I know said Lucy crossly Wait a minute Daughter of Eve said Aslan in a graver voice others also are at the point of death Must more people die for Edmund I m sorry Aslan said Lucy getting up and going with him And for the next half hour they were busy she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone When at last she wa free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his foot and not only healed of his wound but looking better than she had seen him look oh for age in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which wa where he had begun to go wrong He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a Knight Does he know whispered Lucy to Susan what Aslan did for him Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really wa Hush No Of course not said Susan Oughtn t he to be told said Lucy Oh surely not said Susan It would be too awful for him Think how you d feel if you were he All the same I think he ought to know said Lucy But at that moment they were interrupted That night they slept where they were How Aslan provided food for them all I don t know but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o clock Next day they began marching Eastward down the side of the great river And the next day after that at about tea time they actually reached the mouth The castle of Cair Paravel on it little hill towered up above them before them were the sand with rock and little pool of salt water and sea weed and the smell of the sea and long mile of bluish green wave breaking forever and ever on the beach And oh the cry of the sea gull Have you heard it Can you remember That evening after tea the four child all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoe and stocking off and feel the sand between their toe But next day wa more solemn For then in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west door all hung with peacock s feather and the eastern door which open right onto the sea in the presence of all their friend and to the sound of trumpet Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them onto the four throne amid deafening shout of Long Live King Peter Long Live Queen Susan Long Live King Edmund Long Live Queen Lucy Once a king or queen in Narnia always a king or queen Bear it well Sons of Adam Bear it well Daughters of Eve said Aslan And through the Eastern door which wa wide open came the voice of the merman and the mermaid swimming close to the castle step and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens So the child sat in their throne and sceptre were put into their hand and they gave reward and honour to all their friend to Tumnus the Faun and to the Beavers and Giant Rumblebuffin to the leopard and the good centaur and the good dwarf and to the lion And that night there wa a great feast in Cair Paravel and revelry and dancing and gold flashed and wine flowed and answering to the music inside but stranger sweeter and more piercing came the music of the sea people But amidst all these rejoicing Aslan himself quietly slipped away And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn t there they said nothing about it For Mr Beaver had warned them He ll be coming and going he had said One day you ll see him and another you won t He doesn t like being tied down and of course he ha other country to attend to It s quite all right He ll often drop in Only you mustn t press him He s wild you know Not like a tame lion And now a you see this story is nearly but not quite at an end These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well and long and happy wa their reign At first much of their time wa spent in seeking out the remnant of the White Witch s army and destroying them and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil thing lurking in the wilder part of the forest a haunting here and a killing there a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next But in the end all that foul brood wa stamped out And they made good law and kept the peace and saved good tree from being unnecessarily cut down and liberated young dwarf and young satyr from being sent to school and generally stopped busybody and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live And they drove back the fierce giant quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffin on the North of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier And they entered into friendship and alliance with country beyond the sea and paid them visit of state and received visit of state from them And they themselves grew and changed a the year passed over them And Peter became a tall and deep chested man and a great warrior and he wa called King Peter the Magnificent And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her foot and the Kings of the country beyond the sea began to send ambassador asking for her hand in marriage And she wa called Queen Susan the Gentle Edmund wa a graver and quieter man than Peter and great in council and judgement He wa called King Edmund the Just But a for Lucy she wa always gay and golden haired and all Princes in those part desired her to be their Queen and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it wa only a one remembers a dream And one year it fell out that Tumnus who wa a middle aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his part the White Stag who would give you wish if you caught him So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal member of their court rode a hunting with horn and hound in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin till the horse of all the courtier were tired out and only these four were still following And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horse could not follow Then said King Peter for they talked in quite a different style now having been Kings and Queens for so long Fair Consorts let u now alight from our horse and follow this beast into the thicket for in all my day I never hunted a nobler quarry Sir said the others even so let u do So they alighted and tied their horse to tree and went on into the thick wood on foot And a soon a they had entered it Queen Susan said Fair friend here is a great marvel for I seem to see a tree of iron Madam said King Edmund if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof Marry a strange device said King Peter to set a lantern here where the tree cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man Sir said Queen Lucy By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller tree in the place or fewer or none For this is a young wood and the iron post is old And they stood looking upon it Then said King Edmund I know not how it is but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely It run in my mind that I have seen the like before a it were in a dream or in the dream of a dream Sir answered they all it is even so with u also And more said Queen Lucy for it will not go out of my mind that if we pas this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventure or else some great change of our fortune Madam said King Edmund the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also And in mine fair brother said King Peter And in mine too said Queen Susan Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horse and follow this White Stag no further Madam said King Peter therein I pray thee to have me excused For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hand to any high matter a battle quest feat of arm act of justice and the like and then given over but always what we have taken in hand the same we have achieved Sister said Queen Lucy my royal brother speaks rightly And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast a now we have in chase And so say I said King Edmund And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the island Then in the name of Aslan said Queen Susan if ye will all have it so let u go on and take the adventure that shall fall to u So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket and before they had gone a score of pace they all remembered that the thing they had seen wa called a lamp post and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that they were making their way not through branch but through coat And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes It wa the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide Mrs Macready and the visitor were still talking in the passage but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the child weren t caught And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn t been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coat out of his wardrobe were missing And the Professor who wa a very remarkable man didn t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lie but believed the whole story No he said I don t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coat You won t get into Narnia again by that route Nor would the coat be much use by now if you did Eh What s that Yes of course you ll get back to Narnia again some day Once a King in Narnia always a King in Narnia But don t go trying to use the same route twice Indeed don t try to get there at all It ll happen when you re not looking for it And don t talk too much about it even among yourselves And don t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they ve had adventure of the same sort themselves What s that How will you know Oh you ll know all right Odd thing they say even their look will let the secret out Keep your eye open Bless me what do they teach them at these school And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe But if the Professor wa right it wa only the beginning of the adventure of Narnia The End
